b) Which of these two is the larger when it is being interpreted on a computer using
signed-twoâ€™s complement representation?

Certainly! Let's break down the calculations for each number in detail, using signed two's complement representation.

For `11111100`:

starts with a `1`, indicating it's a negative number in signed two's complement representation.

Original: `11111100`

1: Invert the bits -> `00000011`

2: Add `1` -> `00000100`

result, `00000100`, in decimal is `4`. Since the original number was negative, its value is `-4`.

For `01110000`:

starts with a `0`, indicating it's a positive number.

Original: `01110000`

results to `112` in decimal, as it's a positive number.

0 x 2^7 = 0
1 x 2^6 = 64
1 x 2^5 = 32
1 x 2^4 = 16
0 x 2^3 = 0
0 x 2^2 = 0
0 x 2^1 = 0
0 x 2^0 = 0
64 + 32 + 16 = 112

Hence, `11111100` represents `-4` when interpreted as a signed two's complement number, and `01110000` represents `112`, making `01110000` the larger number.

01110000 is the larger number when interpreted on a computer using signed two's complement representation
