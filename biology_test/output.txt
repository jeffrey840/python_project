Vestigial traits are remnants of structures or functions that were present in ancestors but have lost their original purpose over evolutionary time. In this case, the enamelin gene is present in these mammals due to their evolutionary history, even though they no longer have teeth or a functional use for enamel.']

Item 124 parts: ['A nervous impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another by the "release of a neurotransmitter from the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of another neuron" at a synapse. This process involves the release of neurotransmitters, which carry the signal from one neuron to the next across the synaptic gap.']

Item 128 parts: ["The question appears to be incomplete or unclear, making it difficult to determine the correct statement about vertebrate kidney function. Please provide a complete and clear statement or question, and I'll be happy to help you with the information you need."]
Item 129 parts: ["Aplids have piercing mouthparts used to acquire nutrients from plants. An analysis of an aphid's gut tients revealed a solution of sucrose and water. Based on the analysis, which of the following plat uces the source of the sucrose?\n\nCuticle\n\nCambrum\n\nXylem\n\nPhloem\n\nGuard cells"]
Item 130 parts: ['The source of the sucrose in an aphid\'s gut is most likely the "Phloem" of the plant. Phloem is the tissue in plants responsible for transporting sugars, including sucrose, from the leaves (where photosynthesis occurs) to other parts of the plant, including the stem and roots. Aphids feed on plant sap by piercing the phloem and extracting the sugary sap, which is composed of sucrose and water.']
Item 131 parts: ['Which one of the following statements correctly summarizes the movement of energy and matter in a tentesimal ecosystem?\n\nBoth energy and matter repeatedly cycle within the system.\n\nBoth energy and matter flow unidirectionally through the system.\n\nBoth en gy and matter mcrease as they flow through the system.\n\nEnergy flows through the system, matter cycles within the system.\n\nMatter flows through the system, energy cycles within the system.']
Item 132 parts: ['The statement that correctly summarizes the movement of energy and matter in a terrestrial ecosystem is: "Energy flows through the system, matter cycles within the system."\n\nIn terrestrial ecosystems, energy from the sun enters the ecosystem and flows through it, typically in a unidirectional manner, as energy is used by organisms and lost as heat. On the other hand, matter (such as carbon, nitrogen, and other elements) cycles within the ecosystem as it is taken up by organisms, recycled, and returned to the environment.']
Item 133 parts: ['Which of the following structures is correctly paired with its fanction?\n\nMicrovillus.. locomotion\n\nAlveolus.. impulse transmission\n\nGlomerulus.. filtration\n\nNeuron.. nutrient uptake\n\nSarcomere.. gas exchange']
Item 134 parts: ['The structure correctly paired with its function is:\n\n- Glomerulus.. filtration\n\nThe glomerulus is a part of the kidney where blood is filtered to form urine. It plays a crucial role in the filtration of waste products and excess substances from the blood.']
Item 135 parts: ['The structure correctly paired with its function is:\n\n"Glomerulus.. filtration."\n\nThe glomerulus is part of the kidney\'s nephron and is responsible for filtering blood to remove waste products and excess substances, ultimately forming urine. This is its primary function in the excretory system. The other pairs are not correctly matched with their functions.']
