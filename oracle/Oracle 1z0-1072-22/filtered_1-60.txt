[All 1z0-1072-22 Questions]
You created a virtual cloud network (VCN) with three private subnets. Two of the subnets contain application servers and the third subnet contains a DB System. The application requires a shared file system, therefore you have provisioned one using the file storage service (FSS).
You have also created the corresponding mount target in one of the application subnets. The VCN security lists are properly configured so that the application servers can access FSS. The security team changed the settings for the DB System to have read-only access to the file system. However, when they test it, they are unable to access FSS.
How would you allow access to FSS?
A. Modify the security list associated with the subnet where the mount target resides. Change the ingress rules corresponding to the DB System subnet to be stateless.

Company XYZ is spending $300,000.00 USD per month in egress fees for 7 Petabytes that they consume for Outbound Data Transfer in North America with their current cloud provider. The company is seeking to lower that expense considerably without reducing consumption. You propose migration to OCI because the Gigabyte Outbound Data Transfer in North America costs just $0.0085 USD per month. With OCI, how much will they spend per month for 7 Petabytes of Outbound Data Transfer? (1 Petabyte = 1000 Terabytes)
A. $59,500.00
B. $150,000.00
C. $0.00 (free with OCI)
D. $59,415.00

You are responsible for deploying an application on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). The application is memory intensive and performs poorly if enough memory is not available. You have created an instance pool of Linux compute instances in OCI to host the application and defined Autoscaling Configuration for the instance pool.
What should you do to ensure that the instance pool autoscales to prevent poor application performance?
A. Configure the autoscaling policy to monitor memory usage and scale up the number of instances when it meets the threshold.
B. Install the monitoring agent on all compute instances, which triggers the autoscaling group.
C. Configure the autoscaling policy to monitor CPU usage and scale up the number of instances when it meets the threshold.
D. Install OCI SDK on all compute instances and create a script that triggers the autoscaling event if there is high memory usage.

You have multiple applications installed on a compute instance and these applications generate a large amount of log files. These log files must reside on the boot volume for a minimum of 15 days.
Any log files age over 15 days shouldn't be on boot volume but still must be retained for at least 60 days. The 60-day retention requirement is causing an issue with available disk space.
What are two Oracle recommended methods to retain the log files for 60 days without filling up the boot volume? (Choose two.)
A. Terminate the instance while preserving the boot volume. Create a new instance from the boot volume and select a DenseIO shape to take advantage of local NVMe storage.
B. Resize the boot volume of the instance.
C. Create and attach a block volume to the compute instance and copy the log files.
D. Create an object storage bucket and use a script that runs daily to move log files older than 15 days to the bucket.
E. Write a custom script to remove the log files on a daily basis and free up the space on the boot volume.
