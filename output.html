<span class="number">1. The noble revolts known as the Fronde resulted in
</span>
(A) the assassination of Cardinal Mazarin in 1661

(B) renewed power for the Parliament of Paris

(C) a unified noble army securing and increasing its own power

(D) French citizens turning to the monarchy for stability

(E) the establishment of Catholicism as France’s only legal religion



<span class="answer">D. The two Fronde revolts of 1648–1649 and 1651–1652 opposed the regency
</span>
government of the Italian Cardinal Mazarin who attempted to centralize monarchical rule while governing for

the underage Louis XIV. The Paris Parliament and the nobility objected to Mazarin's reforms and new taxes

imposed to pay off debt from the Thirty Years' War. The revolts were undermined as powerful aristocratic

rivals fought among themselves. The revolt concluded with most French agreeing that strong royal rule was

the best guarantee of stability and security.



<span class="number">2. The economic policies of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV’s controller general of finances,
</span>
(A) were noted for their innovation and originality

(B) used new accounting practices to lessen the tax burden on the peasants

(C) were based on mercantilism and stressed state benefits from government regulation of the

economy

(D) gave Louis the large treasury surplus he needed to make war

(E) led to a policy of peace instead of war because of the latter’s great economic costs



<span class="answer">C. Louis XIV's controller general of finance, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, was a
</span>
mercantilist. He favored a heavily regulated economy designed to increase the gold reserves in state coffers.

Colbert subsidized key industries with tax exemptions, loans, and other measures. He also built roads and

canals to encourage domestic trade and commerce and heavily taxed imported manufactured goods.



<span class="number">3. The War of the Spanish Succession was effectively concluded with the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, which
</span>
(A) gave the French king control of Spanish territories

(B) gave France control over the Spanish Netherlands, Naples, and Milan

(C) drove the Bourbons from Spain

(D) destroyed the European balance of power

(E) greatly benefited England, a strong naval power



<span class="answer">E. The Treaty of Utrecht, which ended the War of the Spanish Succession,
</span>
allowed the Bourbons to rule Spain but stated that the two Bourbon kingdoms of Spain and France would

never be united. Austria received the Spanish Netherlands, Naples, and Milan. However, England benefited

the most from the Peace of Utrecht, receiving Gibraltar and French possessions in North America.



<span class="number">4. During the reign of Philip IV, Spain
</span>
(A) suffered under the misrule of the Duke of Lerma

(B) won back its European possessions in the Thirty Years’ War

(C) received a respite from the civil wars and internal revolts common under Philip’s

predecessors

(D) failed to make any real progress, despite reforms under the count of Olivares

(E) lost most of its empire in the New World to England



<span class="answer">D. Spain's power declined significantly after the death of Philip II in
</span>


<span class="number">5. The Austrian Empire in the seventeenth century
</span>
(A) was unified by linguistic and ethnic ties

(B) was defeated at Vienna by a Turkish army in 1687

(C) was a highly centralized, absolutist state under Leopold I

(D) lost a German empire, but gained one in Eastern Europe

(E) was successful in spreading Roman Catholicism throughout Eastern Europe, including Russia



<span class="answer">D. Following the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), the Austrian Habsburgs were
</span>
forced to abandon their ambition to establish a strong empire in Germany. However, during the eighteenth

century, Austria extended its imperial control into Eastern Europe, at the expense of the Ottoman Empire.

The Treaty of Karlowitz (1699) granted Austria control of Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia, and Transylvania.



<span class="number">6. The political institution known as the Sejm made seventeenth-century Poland
</span>
(A) an absolutist, monarchical state dominated by King Sigismund III

(B) a powerful militaristic machine threatening its neighbors

(C) a land without powerful nobles

(D) a constitutional monarchy, similar to that of England

(E) an impotent, decentralized state



<span class="answer">E. Poland's Sejm was Poland's diet or parliament, a two-house legislature
</span>
dominated by the landed aristocracy. In order to gain the throne, prospective Polish monarchs had to agree to

share power with the Sejm in matters of taxation, foreign policy, and administrative appointments. Central

control was extremely limited. The adoption of the liberum veto in 1652 allowed a single dissenting vote to

stop meetings of the Sejm and resulted in chaos.



<span class="number">7. The MOST significant Romanov ruler of the eighteenth century was
</span>
(A) Ivan the Terrible

(B) Nicholas III

(C) Olaf the Great

(D) Peter the Great

(E) Michael



<span class="answer">D. The most significant Romanov tsar of eighteenth–century Russia was Peter the
</span>
Great (r. 1689–1725). Peter decided to westernize Russia and toured Western nations looking for ideas. He

modernized and enlarged the army, created a navy, and reformed the government. However, he kept all

political power in his own hands and required the landed class to serve the state either militarily or in a civil

capacity. He also established control over the Orthodox Church. In attempt to further tie his country to

Western Europe, he established the city of St. Petersburg with its warm-water port.



<span class="number">8. The “Glorious Revolution” in 1688 in England was significant for
</span>
(A) restoring Charles II and the Stuart dynasty to power

(B) bloodlessly deposing James II in favor of William of Orange

(C) returning England to a Catholic commonwealth

(D) Parliament’s establishment of a new monarch through a series of bloody wars

(E) the separation of England from Scotland



<span class="answer">B. James II sparked the Glorious Revolution when he suspended laws in an effort
</span>
to restore Catholicism in England. In 1688, William of Orange invaded England with broad support from

England's elite and drove James into exile. The Glorious Revolution was peaceful and the eventual settlement

increased the influence of Parliament by requiring William and his wife, Mary, to accept a bill of rights

before ascending to the throne. In 1707, England and Scotland were formally joined in the United Kingdom.



<span class="number">9. Thomas Hobbes
</span>
(A) believed that a state of nature without government or social institutions best ensured human

happiness

(B) stated that mankind was animalistic and needed a strong government to maintain social order

(C) was a firm believer in representative democracy

(D) supported theocratic rule under the guidance of the Vatican

(E) declared that the institution of divine right meant that monarchy was the best form of

government



<span class="answer">B. In 1651, Thomas Hobbes published his Leviathan, which was based on
</span>
observations made during the violent upheavals of the English Civil War of the prior decade. Hobbes

believed that humans benefited greatly from the social cohesion provided by a strong state. He is famous for

claiming that without rulers, humans faced a life that was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." Faced

with the unpleasant implication of anarchy, humans made an agreement to form a society or a

commonwealth. Hobbes believed that in order to preserve the peace within the commonwealth, absolute

power needed to be vested in a sovereign authority, usually a monarch. Hobbs was not a democrat.



<span class="number">10. The artistic style represented in this illustration of Bernini’s The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa is
</span>
(A) Neo-Gothic

(B) High Renaissance

(C) Mannerist

(D) Baroque

(E) Rococo



<span class="answer">D. Gian Lorenzo Bernini's The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa is a famous example of
</span>
Baroque art. It was commissioned for the Cornaro Chapel in the Church of Santa Maria della Vittoria in

Rome. The Baroque style combined classical ideals of the Renaissance with the spirituality of the Catholic

Reformation and used dramatic effects to arouse strong emotions in the viewer. Noted for its rich detail, the

Baroque style was particularly popular at Versailles and other royal palaces of the seventeenth century.



<span class="number">11. In her Instruction, Catherine the Great outlined enlightened legal reforms that
</span>
(A) abolished serfdom throughout Russia

(B) established equality before the law for all Russian citizens

(C) instigated changes in the Russian government that sapped the power of the old nobility

(D) accomplished little and were soon forgotten due to heavy opposition

(E) ended capital punishment



<span class="answer">D. Catherine the Great corresponded with several of the Enlightenment
</span>
philosophes and decided to reform Russia. In her Instruction (1767), she criticized serfdom, the use of torture

and capital punishment, and advocated the principle of equality. Her attempts at reform failed, and her

Instruction was quickly forgotten. In fact, serfdom increased during her reign and was not abolished until

1861 by Alexander II.



<span class="number">12. Catherine the Great of Russia
</span>
(A) followed a successful policy of expansion against the Turks

(B) instigated enlightened reforms for the peasantry after the revolt of Emelyn Pugachev

(C) alienated the nobility with her extensive enlightened reforms

(D) successfully eliminated the power of the Duma

(E) was driven out of European Russia by Prussia’s Frederick the Great



[No corresponding answer and explanation found.]



<span class="number">13. With regard to politics, King Frederick the Great of Prussia believed that the fundamental rule of
</span>
governments is to

(A) respect new human rights

(B) expand their territories

(C) combat church fanaticism

(D) raise taxes to meet all military needs of state spending

(E) equalizing social and economic differences among its citizens



<span class="answer">B. Frederick II the Great of Prussia was one of the most intellectual rulers of the
</span>
eighteenth century and corresponded extensively with Voltaire. However, when it came to foreign policy, he

was more traditional. He claimed, "The fundamental rule of governments is the principle of extending their

territories." He did so in two wars against Austria's Maria Theresa and seized Silesia from Austria.



<span class="number">14. Which of the following financial advantages did the British government enjoy over French rulers of the
</span>
eighteenth century?

(A) Britain could borrow large sums of money at low rates of interest.

(B) The British government had a lower total amount of debt.

(C) Britain had a strong policy against state borrowing of any kind.

(D) France had no real curbs on its borrowing.

(E) Britain lacked costly colonial obligations and responsibilities.



<span class="answer">A. The Bank of England was established in 1694, allowing the British
</span>
government to borrow large sums of money at low interest rates. In addition to issuing paper currency, or

banknotes, the Bank backed government bonds that paid a fixed rate of return. The creation of "public debt"

allowed Britain to raise large sums of capital to finance government activities without incurring prohibitively

high interest expenses.



<span class="number">15. Improvements in eighteenth-century European agricultural methods and practices occurred primarily in
</span>
(A) France

(B) the Netherlands

(C) Britain

(D) Russia

(E) Poland



<span class="answer">C. In the eighteenth century, England led the Agricultural Revolution. New
</span>
techniques, crops, and land use practices dramatically increased farm yields. Agriculturalists discovered that

the use of crops such as turnips or clover could increase nitrogen in the soil, thereby increasing productivity.

Parliament passed the Enclosure Acts that led to the formation of larger and more productive estates by

combining many small farms. These improvements made more food available to England's population on the

eve of the age of industrialization and urbanization.



<span class="number">16. Before the industrial revolution in eighteenth-century Europe, rural workers produced textiles using such
</span>
tools as spinning wheels, distaffs, and spindles. Their combined efforts came to be known as

(A) work houses

(B) cottage industries

(C) peasant piece-work shops

(D) textile factories

(E) sweatshops



<span class="answer">B. Textiles were the most important European industry of the eighteenth century.
</span>
Before the Industrial Revolution, rural workers produced textiles using such tools as distaffs, spindles, and



<span class="number">17. All of these authorities were relied on by medieval scholars EXCEPT
</span>
(A) Aristotle

(B) Galen

(C) Ptolemy

(D) Curie

(E) Archimedes



<span class="answer">D. Aristotle was a Greek philosopher of the fourth century BCE, Galen was a
</span>
Greek physician of the second century CE, Claudius Ptolemy was an astronomer of the second century CE,

and Archimedes was a scientist and mathematician from the third century BCE. All would have been

influential in the Middle Ages. However, Marie Curie could not have been, inasmuch as she worked in the

twentieth century.



<span class="number">18. Galileo’s observations resulted in the dramatic finding that the
</span>
(A) orbits of planets were elliptical rather than circular

(B) planets were made of materials similar to those found on Earth

(C) the solar system was much larger than previously thought

(D) the stars were smaller than previously thought

(E) Jupiter had more rings than Saturn



<span class="answer">B. Galileo used his telescope to discover that other bodies of the universe were
</span>
composed of substances similar to those making up the earth. Traditional theories of Aristotle and Ptolemy

held that heavenly bodies were perfect and composed of a nonmaterial and incorruptible essence.



<span class="number">19. Which of the following Greco-Roman doctors had the GREATEST influence on medieval medical
</span>
thought?

(A) Hippocrates

(B) Rhazes

(C) Galen

(D) Aristotle

(E) Paracelsus



<span class="answer">C. Late medieval medical theory was dominated by the ideas of Galen, a secondcentury CE Greek physician. His influence in anatomy, physiology, disease theories, and medical practices
</span>
was profound. However, because Galen practiced dissection on animals rather than humans, his theories of

human anatomy were often incorrect.



<span class="number">20. William Harvey’s On the Motion of the Heart and Blood refuted the idea that the
</span>
(A) immune system was governed by the pancreas

(B) liver was the beginning point of circulation of blood

(C) lymph system functioned independently

(D) traditional herbal healing methods were effective blood cleansers

(E) primary transmission of disease was through bad blood



<span class="answer">B. William Harvey's On the Motion of the Heart and Blood, published in 1628,
</span>
refuted Galen's contention that the liver was the beginning point in the circulation of blood. Harvey

accurately observed that it was the heart that was the starting point and that blood makes a complete circuit as

it passes through the body's veins and arteries.



<span class="number">21. Descartes believed that the world could be understood using
</span>
(A) the same principles inherent in mathematical thinking

(B) quiet contemplation of the Holy Scriptures

(C) lessons learned from mystical experiences

(D) insights gained from the interpretation of dreams

(E) an imagined tabula rasa



<span class="answer">A. In 1619, Descartes first proposed that the world could be understood using the
</span>
same principles as those inherent in mathematics. He fully developed his groundbreaking theories in

Discourse on Method,



<span class="number">22. Spinoza believed that a failure to understand God led
</span>
(A) to the false worship of nature

(B) people to use nature for their own self-interest

(C) individuals to incorrectly judge the morality of others

(D) the faithful to sexual perversion

(E) to a separation of mind and body



<span class="answer">B. Benedict de Spinoza was a pantheist who believed that God was the universe,
</span>
not just the creator of the universe. Human beings were not separate from God, but were a part of God and

nature. Spinoza believed that when people misunderstood the all-inclusiveness of God, they separated God

from nature and used nature for their own self-interest without respect for the divinity of all creation.



<span class="number">23. Which of the following was a key figure of the Scientific Revolution who inspired the search for natural
</span>
laws in numerous fields, including sociology and economics?

(A) Galileo

(B) Newton

(C) Descartes

(D) Pascal

(E) Copernicus



<span class="answer">B. Isaac Newton, who created mechanistic and orderly explanations for a number
</span>
of physical phenomena, was a key figure of the Scientific Revolution. The clarity and power of his reasoning

inspired others to search for natural laws in other fields, including society, economics, politics, economics,

justice, religion, and the arts.



<span class="number">24. The French philosophes
</span>
(A) were literate intellectuals who hoped to change the world using reason and rationality

(B) flourished in an atmosphere of government support

(C) sought to prevent the expansion of the Enlightenment to other states

(D) encouraged state censorship of ideas contrary to their own

(E) were academic philosophers associated with the University of Paris and other French

universities



<span class="answer">A. Intellectuals in the Enlightenment were known by the French term
</span>
philosophes, although not all were French or formal philosophers. Most philosophes were either middle class

or members of the aristocracy, and they shared a desire to change the world by applying the lessons learned

through rational criticism of the existing political and religious institutions and practices.



<span class="number">25. Which of the following cities was the recognized capital of the Enlightenment?
</span>
(A) Geneva

(B) Berlin

(C) London

(D) Paris

(E) Rome



<span class="answer">D. Paris was the recognized capital of the Enlightenment. Many of the leading
</span>
figures of the Enlightenment were French, including Voltaire, Montesquieu, Diderot, and Rousseau.

However, Kant was German, and the intellectual fathers of the Enlightenment, Locke and Newton, were

British, as were the historian Gibbon and the philosopher Hume.



<span class="number">26. European intellectual life of the eighteenth century was marked by the emergence of
</span>
(A) anti-Semitism and greater persecution of minorities

(B) secularization and a search to find the natural laws governing human life

(C) sophism and the mockery of past traditions

(D) monastic schools and medieval modes of religious training

(E) the separation of the institutions of church and state across all of Europe



<span class="answer">B. The Scientific Revolution was a major turning point in Western history. The
</span>
discoveries of Galileo, Copernicus, and Newton removed the earth from the center of the universe and

demonstrated that the movement of a falling apple and the rotations of the planets could be explained using

mathematical laws. This break with the past weakened the influence of religion and heralded the emergence

of a more secular society and the quest to discover natural laws governing nearly every aspect of human

endeavor.



<span class="number">27. Diderot’s contributions to Enlightenment efforts against religious fanaticism, intolerance, and prudery is
</span>
BEST exemplified in his

(A) brilliant play “Is Rome Burning?”

(B) twenty-eight volume Encyclopedia compiling articles from numerous philosophes

(C) autobiography published in French

(D) biography of Newton, “the greatest Europe has ever known”

(E) Confessions



<span class="answer">B. Denis Diderot's major contribution to the Enlightenment was his twenty-eight
</span>
volume Encyclopedia, or Classified Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Trades. The Encyclopedia included

articles by many of the philosophes, who attacked religious superstition and urged social, legal, and political

reforms. The philosophes hoped to build a society that was more humane, tolerant, cosmopolitan, and based

on reason.



<span class="number">28. Deism was based on
</span>
(A) Newton’s conception of a rational universe following scientific laws

(B) God answering prayers directed to him in song and poetry

(C) the divinity of Jesus as son of the prime mover of the rational universe

(D) the denial of the existence of any Supreme Being

(E) the pantheism of Spinoza and other enlightened philosophers



<span class="answer">A. Deism was an outgrowth of Newton's world-machine. Deism posited that
</span>
there was a mechanical universe created by God to operate according to mathematical and scientific laws. A

number of enlightenment figures embraced the rationality of Deism and rejected traditional religion,

including Christianity, which they claimed was irrational and based upon superstition.



<span class="number">29. In The Social Contract, Rousseau expressed his belief that
</span>
(A) government was an evil that should be eliminated

(B) an individual’s will is most important

(C) freedom is achieved by being forced to follow the “general will,” or what is best for all

(D) a child was a small adult with all the same abilities and obligations

(E) in nature, human life was “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short”



<span class="answer">C. In The Social Contract, Jean Jacques Rousseau argued that government was a
</span>
necessary evil, created to preserve private property. Individuals came together to form a social contract and

agree to be governed by the general will. Since only the general will can lead to happiness for all, an

individual cannot be allowed to follow his narrow self-interest. In Rousseau's definition, freedom is obeying

the laws that one has imposed on oneself by accepting the social contract.



<span class="number">30. The illustration shows which of the following eighteenth-century composers who composed
</span>
groundbreaking concertoes, symphonies, and operas, such as The Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni?

(A) Johann Sebastian Bach

(B) George Frederick Handel

(C) Franz Joseph Haydn

(D) Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart

(E) Ludwig van Beethoven



<span class="answer">D. The musical forms of the concerto, symphony, and opera all reached their
</span>
zenith in the musical compositions of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. A child prodigy, Mozart perfected the

Italian comic opera in The Marriage of Figaro, which ranks with his The Magic Flute and Don Giovanni as

one of the world's greatest operas.



<span class="number">31. High culture in eighteenth-century Europe was influenced by the
</span>
(A) enormous impact of the book publishing industry

(B) decline of French as an international language

(C) decline of magazine circulations with the rise of the novel

(D) increased dependency of authors on wealthy patrons

(E) its exclusive focus upon religious subject matter



<span class="answer">A. Latin was the international language of eighteenth-century European elite
</span>
scientists, philosophers, poets, dramatists, and other intellectuals. However, the expansion of book publishing

revolutionized European high culture, as the use of national languages produced an increase in the exchange

of ideas between elites and the new reading public of the middle class.



<span class="number">32. The punishment of crime in the eighteenth century was often
</span>
(A) public and very gruesome

(B) carried out by mobs after the criminals were charged in court

(C) less severe than the crime would merit

(D) the responsibility of the army

(E) reduced to probation and fines due to the influence of the churches and philosophers



<span class="answer">A. Punishments for crime in the eighteenth century were cruel and gruesome.
</span>
Torture was common, and courts used the rack and thumbscrew to obtain confessions. Executions were

usually carried out in public, supposedly as a deterrent to others, but the masses came for the spectacle itself.

In 1800, there were over two hundred crimes in England that were subject to the death penalty, and public

hangings continued in London until the late nineteenth century.



<span class="number">33. John Wesley
</span>
(A) was responsible for the resurgence of Catholic piety

(B) supported a rationalistic approach to Protestantism

(C) spread the teachings of pietism through his Moravian Brethren

(D) created and controlled his evangelical Methodist church using revivalist techniques

(E) was a leading Deist



<span class="answer">D. The established churches of the eighteenth century offered followers little
</span>
spiritual reward. In England, John Wesley took religion to the masses by preaching in open fields and public

spaces. He was a charismatic speaker who appealed to the lower classes, whose religious needs had been

ignored by the Anglican elite. Wesley's Methodism remained a part of the Anglican Church until long after

his death.



<span class="number">34. The American colonists were able win their war for independence because of
</span>
(A) generous military and financial aid from France

(B) the collapse of the English colonial system

(C) apathy of the English military

(D) flaws in the English mercantile system

(E) George III’s recognition of colonial independence 1776



<span class="answer">A. Economic and military assistance provided by France and other European
</span>
nations were a crucial factor in the American fight for independence. Frenchmen served as officers in

Washington's army, and a French fleet prohibited British reinforcements from reaching the battlefield at the

crucial Battle of Yorktown in



<span class="number">35. The American Revolution had which of the following effects on Europeans?
</span>
(A) Showing that military force was the final diplomatic authority

(B) Ending colonial expansion around the world

(C) Establishing that the new United States was the most powerful nation

(D) Demonstrating that the ideas of the Enlightenment could be realized politically

(E) Revealing that mighty England could be defeated



<span class="answer">D. The American Revolution showed Europeans that the ideas of the
</span>
Enlightenment could be implemented successfully to form a new society. The Declaration of Independence

expressed the Enlightenment concept of natural rights, while the Articles of Confederation and the

Constitution were social contracts established in a real political context.



<span class="number">36. Which of the following was the MOST immediate cause of the French Revolution?
</span>
(A) The government failed to resolve its debt and other economic problems.

(B) Reforms were blocked by the French Parliament.

(C) The philosophes called for radical reforms.

(D) Louis XVI’s rejected the cahiers de doléances.

(E) Peasant rioted in the countryside.



<span class="answer">A. The French economy grew well during the second half of the eighteenth
</span>
century, despite bad harvests in 1787 and 1788 that led to food shortages. In contrast, the French government

fell deep into debt after costly wars and royal extravagances. After trying to borrow its way to solvency, the

government reluctantly admitted that additional taxes were necessary. The institution of new taxes required

the consent of the Estates-General, which assembled at Versailles in the spring of



<span class="number">37. Compared to the American Revolution, the French Revolution was
</span>
(A) more violent

(B) more radical

(C) more influential in Europe as a model of rebellion

(D) more influential to most of the world outside Europe as a model of revolution

(E) All of the above



<span class="answer">E. Although the American Revolution had considerable influence in Europe and
</span>
in France, the French Revolution was more violent (e.g., the execution of Louis XVI and the Terror of 1793–

1794); more radical (e.g., full male democracy, the worship of pure reason, and the revolutionary calendar);

and more influential, both in Europe and the rest of the world, as a model of revolution (e.g., Russian

Revolution of 1917 and the Chinese Communist Revolution of 1946–1949).



<span class="number">38. In 1789, the Estates-General
</span>
(A) was an advisory body that was often consulted by King Louis XVI

(B) unanimously agreed that only radical change could solve France’s problems

(C) was dominated by the First Estate composed mostly of urban lawyers

(D) was deeply divided over the issue of whether to vote by Estates or by head

(E) was trying to seize power from the National Assembly



<span class="answer">D. When the Estates-General assembled at Versailles in May 1789, members
</span>
immediately disagreed over what voting procedure to follow. The First Estate (clergy) and the Second Estate

(nobility) each had 300 representatives. The Third Estate (the vast majority of the population) had 600

representatives. Voting by Estate would allow the privileged estates to out-vote the Third Estate. However,

voting by head might grant the Third Estate victory if a few sympathetic nobles would help them obtain

control. When disagreements over voting resulted in deadlock, the Third Estate declared itself to be the

National Assembly.



<span class="number">39. Just prior to the Revolution in France, the number of poor people in France
</span>
(A) declined

(B) increased greatly

(C) increased slightly

(D) remained the same

(E) declined slightly



<span class="answer">B. The number of poor in France in the late eighteenth century is estimated at
</span>
being about one third of the total population. Poor harvests in 1787 and 1788 and subsequent food shortages

dramatically increased the number of poor and produced a crisis by the eve of the revolution.



<span class="number">40. Which of the following slogans from the French Revolution neatly evoked the ideals of the rebellion?
</span>
(A) “Down with the aristocracy!”

(B) “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!”

(C) “Death to the king and queen!”

(D) “Kill all priests and burn all churches!”

(E) “Vive l’Empereur!”



<span class="answer">B. The upheavals of the French Revolution led to new liberal and national
</span>
political ideals most famously expressed in the slogan, "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!" The slogan

incorporates Enlightenment commitments to liberty and equality with the emerging fraternity of nationalism.

In significant ways, the French Revolution laid the foundations for modern nationalism.



<span class="number">41. The Bastille was
</span>
(A) the king’s castle

(B) an arsenal and prison

(C) the place where most state executions took place

(D) a monastery

(E) a royal palace



<span class="answer">B. The Bastille was an old medieval fortress in Paris. At the time of the
</span>
revolution, it served as a royal armory and a government prison. Rumors of events at Versailles and the callup of troops inflamed much of the Paris populace. On July 14, 1789, they surrounded the Bastille, seeking

weapons, but also with the intent of releasing the many political prisoners they believed were being held



<span class="number">42. The National Assembly’s approach towards the Catholic Church was to
</span>
(A) leave the institution alone

(B) increase its power dramatically in France

(C) pass legislation to secularized the church offices and clergy

(D) ban Catholicism from France

(E) force the Church to ordain women as priests



<span class="answer">C. The Catholic Church was a symbol of the Old Regime and therefore very
</span>
unpopular among many of the revolutionaries. Revolutionaries confiscated Church property to remedy

economic problems inherited from the monarchy. The Civil Constitution of the Clergy granted the people the

right to elect Church bishops and priests and authorized them to receive a government salary. The clergy were

also required to swear an oath of allegiance to the new civil constitution. Many of the clergy, including the

pope, objected vehemently, leading to a counterrevolutionary movement in France.



<span class="number">43. During the 1790s, the army of the French Republic
</span>
(A) received little backing from the home front

(B) was small but effective in battle

(C) continued to be commanded by members of the Bourbon family

(D) was totally defeated by foreign aristocratic forces

(E) fueled modern nationalism and was raised through total mobilization of the population



<span class="answer">E. Although revolutionary ideals were supposed to give France victory against its
</span>
foreign royalist enemies, by 1793 French armies suffered defeats and a foreign coalition was poised to invade

France. In August 1793, the Committee of Public Safety ordered the universal mobilization of the French

populace. In just over a year, the French army numbered 1,169,000 soldiers. The people's government had

brought forth a new people's army that fought for France itself, not just for a king or a royal dynasty. This

new conception of the nation-state marked the birth of modern nationalism.



<span class="number">44. Which of the following monarch’s head is being exhibited in the illustration?
</span>
(A) Charles I of England

(B) Louis XV of France

(C) Louis XVI of France

(D) James II of England

(E) Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria



<span class="answer">C. In January 1793, Louis XVI was publicly executed in Paris by use of the new
</span>
enlightened method of execution, the guillotine. By that date, Louis had already lost his throne when France

abolished the monarchy and established a republic. England's Charles I was beheaded by an axe, and James II

went into exile. Louis XV died of natural causes, and in 1914 Archduke Francis Ferdinand was shot in

Sarajevo.



<span class="number">45. Napoleon’s rapid rise to power was based on his
</span>
(A) series of stunning defeats over the enemies of France

(B) social programs that appealed to the masses

(C) promises to make France great again

(D) supporters within an inner clique of revolutionaries dedicated to the general

(E) personal charisma and his family connections to the Bourbons



<span class="answer">A. Napoleon was an outsider born on the island of Corsica and would never have
</span>
achieved high rank or status in France under the royalist regime. The revolution made Napoleon's career

possible. Beginning in 1792, he rose quickly through the ranks of the French army, becoming a brigadier

general in 1794 when he was only twenty-five. In 1796, he commanded the French armies in Italy, where he

defeated the Austrians. By 1797, Napoleon had become a hero because of his military victories. A few years

later, he became the emperor of France.



<span class="number">46. Which of the following was NOT a factor that contributed to Napoleon’s defeat?
</span>
(A) The failure of the Continental System

(B) The defeat of the French navy at the Battle of Trafalgar

(C) The unmanageable rebellions provoked by his brutal rule over conquered countries

(D) The spread of nationalism in the conquered countries

(E) The invasion of Russia



<span class="answer">C. Although Napoleon was still at war with Britain and needed to maintain order
</span>
in conquered countries, his rule reflected the ideals of the Revolution and the Enlightenment. Legal equality,

religious toleration, and economic freedoms were incorporated into his imperial rule. He did not use brutal

suppression to control the populations of the countries he conquered.



<span class="number">47. Klemens von Metternich
</span>
(A) continued to incorporate revolutionary values into his government following Napoleon’s

defeat

(B) believed that a free press was necessary to maintain the status quo in Europe

(C) was a political reactionary, but believed that a republic was the best way to ensure order

(D) was anti-religious and supported atheistic causes in Eastern Europe and Russia

(E) believed European monarchs shared a common interest in promoting stability



<span class="answer">E. Prince Klemens von Metternich, the Austrian foreign minister, was the key
</span>
figure at the Congress of Vienna that ended the Napoleonic wars. Metternich promoted the principle of

legitimacy to restore monarchies and protect religion. Metternich understood that the monarchs of Europe

shared a common interest in stability following the upheavals brought on by the French Revolution. He

created the Quadruple Alliance and the congress system to reestablish and maintain stability.



<span class="number">48. The Industrial Revolution in Britain was largely inspired by
</span>
(A) an urgent need to reduce eighteenth-century poverty

(B) the failure of the cottage industry

(C) entrepreneurs who sought and accepted the new manufacturing methods of inventions

(D) the Dutch and French industrialization

(E) the availability of substantial amounts of English-grown cotton



<span class="answer">C. The Industrial Revolution in Britain was inspired by entrepreneurs who sought
</span>
out and applied new manufacturing methods and technologies. The water frame, Crompton's mule, power

looms, and the steam engine powered the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain. Cottage industry did not fail,

but it was superseded by new equipment and factories. France and Holland industrialized after the British.

Cotton was an import to Britain, but it was not grown domestically.



<span class="number">49. The invention of the steam engine in Britain was initially triggered by
</span>
(A) the textile industry’s demand for new sources of power

(B) problems in the mining industry

(C) the railroad industry’s call for a more efficient source of power

(D) the need for a more efficient mode of power for English ships

(E) the need to replace sailing ships with steam power



<span class="answer">B. The problem of water seepage deep in British coalmines spurred on the
</span>
invention of the steam engine. Horse-drawn mechanical pumps were first used, but the need for more

efficient pumps led Thomas Newcomen to invent the steam pump in



<span class="number">50. The success of the steam engine in the Industrial Revolution made Britain dependent upon
</span>
(A) timber

(B) coal

(C) water power

(D) electricity

(E) railroads



<span class="answer">B. Britain was fortunate to have considerable iron and coal deposits. Without iron
</span>
and coal, Britain would probably not have become the world's first industrialized nation. Coal in particular

was crucial to the powering of the steam engine. Coal played the pivotal role in the economies of the First

Industrial Revolution that oil plays today.



<span class="number">51. The rise of the industrial factory system deeply changed the quality of life and social status of workers
</span>
who

(A) were traditionally paid in kind

(B) lost ownership of the means of production, becoming simple wage earners

(C) were less vulnerable to more rapid cycles of economic boom and bust

(D) got both good wages and many fringe benefits unknown before

(E) saw entire family units working together in factories



<span class="answer">B. The replacement of cottage industries by industrial factories radically changed
</span>
workers' lives. Unlike the cottage industry system, where workers owned all the tools and equipment used for

production, factory workers used the firms' equipment and sold only their labor to factory owners. Low

wages, long hours, and difficult and dangerous working conditions were the norm. The cyclical boom-bust

economic cycles produced periodic unemployment that workers were forced to weather without

unemployment insurance or other benefits.



<span class="number">52. Industrialization began on the continent first in
</span>
(A) Spain and Italy

(B) Austria and Poland

(C) Russia and Sweden

(D) Norway and Denmark

(E) Belgium and Germany



<span class="answer">E. Industrialization began on the continent first in Belgium and Germany, along
</span>
with France. By 1850, only Belgium and Germany had completed the major parts of their railroad systems

that integrated their growing industrial economies. Eastern and southern Europe lagged behind northern and

western Europe. At the end of the nineteenth century, Imperial Russia was still less industrialized than the

West.



<span class="number">53. The Industrial Revolution in continental Europe
</span>
(A) was a generation behind Britain in cotton manufacture

(B) neglected coal and iron technology in favor of the progress in the textile industry

(C) benefited from the discovery of vast coal deposits in Germany in the 1820s

(D) would remain far behind the British until the twentieth century

(E) quickly surpassed Britain’s production of cotton cloth



<span class="answer">A. Even France, the continental leader in cotton manufacturing, lagged far behind
</span>
Great Britain. In 1849, French mills used 64,000 tons of raw cotton, far less than the British cotton industry,

which transformed 286,000 tons of raw cotton into cotton cloth and other goods.



<span class="number">54. The European population explosion of the nineteenth century was
</span>
(A) the result of increased birthrates across Europe

(B) largely attributable to the disappearance of famine from much of Europe

(C) caused by a lack of emigration

(D) remarkable because of the preponderance of major epidemic diseases

(E) limited to Catholic countries



<span class="answer">B. The nineteenth-century increase in European population was due primarily to
</span>
improved food supplies that virtually eliminated famine. Medical advances and improved sanitation also

reduced disease deaths, and there were fewer major wars than in previous centuries. Birthrates had actually

begun to decline after



<span class="number">55. Industrialization produced many demographic changes and caused the
</span>
(A) landed aristocracy to move from cities to escape the ill effects of factory development

(B) new middle class to move to the suburbs of cities to escape the urban poor

(C) newly affluent laboring class to live in diverse locations

(D) rich and poor to live together more often in new suburban housing developments

(E) rich to build large mansions and palaces close to the urban seats of government



<span class="answer">B. An urban explosion took place in the nineteenth century, largely as a
</span>
consequence of the Industrial Revolution. The working poor, or the factory laborers, inhabited the center of

burgeoning industrial cities. Middle-class citizens moved to the suburbs to distance themselves from the

resulting urban pollution and poverty. They settled in suburban rings surrounding the cities where they could

have individual homes and gardens.



<span class="number">56. The illustration by the leading nineteenth-century graphic artist Gustave Dore depicts
</span>
(A) Parisian workers' housing built by Napoleon III and Georges Haussmann

(B) a late medieval city in Germany

(C) a planned utopian socialist community in Russia

(D) a London slum

(E) prosperous eighteenth-century Amsterdam with its traditional narrow houses



<span class="answer">D. Gustave Dore published a series of illustrations of mid-nineteenth-century
</span>
London. His book portrayed all of London society from the wealthy West End to the poverty stricken East

End. This picture shows the crowded and disease-ridden slums of industrial London where the streets were

filled with garbage and human waste.



<span class="number">57. The Luddites
</span>
(A) received little support in their areas of activity

(B) destroyed industrial machines that threatened their livelihood

(C) were composed of the lowest unskilled workers in Great Britain

(D) was the first movement of working-class consciousness of the Continent

(E) were a phenomenon of continental industrialization



<span class="answer">B. The Luddites, led by a mythical "King Ludd" or "Ned Ludd", were skilled
</span>
English craftsmen, mostly from the cotton cloth trade. In 1812, they destroyed the factories and machines

they believed were threatening their livelihoods. The term "Luddite" is now used to describe anyone who is



<span class="number">58. The Greek independence rebellion was successful largely because of
</span>
(A) a well-trained guerrilla army

(B) the Turks’ lack of fortitude

(C) European intervention

(D) superior Greek military tactics

(E) the superior Greeks defense of the acropolis



<span class="answer">C. European intervention by France, Britain, and Russia helped the Greeks to
</span>
regain their freedom from the Ottomans in



<span class="number">59. Which of the following statements about Tsar Alexander I of Russia is NOT correct?
</span>
(A) He became more reactionary following the defeat of Napoleon.

(B) He promulgated a new constitution, freeing the serfs.

(C) He reformed the Russian education system.

(D) He adopted a program of arbitrary censorship to strengthen autocratic rule.

(E) He died without an heir in 1825, leading to a dispute over who should become the next tsar.



<span class="answer">B. Alexander I (1800–1825) was raised to believe in Enlightenment ideals and
</span>
began his reign as a reformer, relaxing censorship and improving the educational system. However, he

became more reactionary after the defeat of Napoleon and refused to approve a constitution freeing the serfs.

Following his death, a number of military officials, the Decembrists, launched a failed attempted to establish

a Russian constitutional monarchy in Russia.



<span class="number">60. Nineteenth-century liberalism was MOST warmly embraced by
</span>
(A) factory workers

(B) the industrial middle class

(C) radical aristocrats

(D) army officers

(E) large landowners



<span class="answer">B. The industrial middle class warmly embraced the ideals of nineteenth-century
</span>
liberalism. It emphasized individual political and economic freedoms and the laissez-faire policies of limited

government. Liberals also advocated legal equality, freedom of speech and the press, and written

constitutions. However, liberals of the nineteenth century were not democrats and believed full political

rights should be extended only to individuals who met strict requirements of property ownership.



<span class="number">61. The 1832, British Reform Bill primarily benefited the
</span>
(A) landed aristocracy

(B) upper-middle class

(C) working class

(D) clergy

(E) formally educated



<span class="answer">B. The upper middle class benefited the most from the Reform Bill of

<span class="number">62. In 1848, the Frankfurt Assembly
</span>
(A) unanimously adopted a Grossdeutsch solution for the Germanies

(B) succeeded in making Prussia’s Frederick William IV president of a united Germany

(C) failed in its attempt to create a united Germany

(D) gained the support of Austria

(E) successfully organized a military uprising that unified all of Germany under Prussian

leadership



<span class="answer">C. The German Confederation's Frankfurt Assembly was dominated by educated
</span>
middle-class delegates who were professors, lawyers, journalists, and bureaucrats. Many were also

nationalists who wanted a single unified German state. When the assembly offered the title of "Emperor of

the Germans" to Prussia's William Frederick IV, he turned it down and ordered the Prussian delegates to

return home. The assembly soon disbanded, failing in its attempt to create a united Germany.



<span class="number">63. The creation of professional police forces and prison improvements were geared toward
</span>
(A) the creation of more disciplined and law-abiding societies

(B) lessening public outcry over poor living conditions for convicts

(C) protecting the poor from exploitation by businessmen and the rich

(D) adding an element of fear to society for psychological manipulation of mass populations

(E) the rehabilitation and reintegration into society of the most violent criminals



<span class="answer">A. Prison reform and professional police forces of the nineteenth century were
</span>
geared toward the creation of a more disciplined society. Extensive and excessive use of capital punishment

had proved ineffective. Greater emphasis was placed upon incarceration, although the debate continued over

whether prisons should only punish or also rehabilitate inmates.



<span class="number">64. The MOST important form of literary expression for the Romantics was
</span>
(A) the educational treatise

(B) poetry

(C) the novel

(D) the play

(E) the historical biography



<span class="answer">B. Sentiment and individualism formed the keystone of the Romantic movement,
</span>
and Romantics considered poetry to be the most important form of literary expression. They claimed that

Poetry allowed the direct expression of one's soul, revealing a hidden and invisible world to others. The most

prominent English Romantic poets were Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, John Keats, and William

Wordsworth.



<span class="number">65. Which of the following artists painted the impressionistic Rain, Steam, and Speed—The Great Western
</span>
Railroad shown in the illustration?

(A) Caspar David Friedrich

(B) Joseph Malford William Turner

(C) Eugene Delacroix

(D) John-Francois Millet

(E) Paul Cezanne



<span class="answer">B. Like many Romantic artists, J.M.W. Turner turned to nature for his subjects.
</span>
However, where many Romantic artists included realistic detail in their works, Turner anticipated later



<span class="number">66. In economic matters, Napoleon III
</span>
(A) had a laissez-faire attitude

(B) gave to France a larger empire than even that of Britain

(C) strove to diminish the power of great industrialists

(D) established monopolies for foreign firms with expertise lacking in French firms

(E) used government resources to stimulate the national economy and industrial growth



<span class="answer">E. Napoleon III, like his uncle, Napoleon Bonaparte, was an authoritarian ruler.
</span>
His did not accept the economic ideology from nineteenth-century liberalism that emphasized laissez-faire

policies. Instead, Napoleon III used government resources to stimulate the French economy and to promote

industrial growth. The most famous example of his activist government policy was the rebuilding of Paris

under the direction of Baron Haussmann.



<span class="number">67. The Red Shirts’ leader whose military command helped unify Italy was
</span>
(A) Prince Napoleon

(B) Giuseppe Garibaldi

(C) Victor Emmanuel II

(D) Camillo di Cavour

(E) Charles Albert



<span class="answer">B. In 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi invaded Sicily with an army of a thousand Red
</span>
Shirt volunteers. Garibaldi, a former supporter of Giuseppe Mazini and the Young Italy Movement, soon

gained control of Sicily. Moving to the Italian mainland, he quickly conquered the Kingdom of the Two

Sicilies. Although Garibaldi favored a republic, he allowed Count Cavour, prime minister of Piedmont, to

establish the kingdom of Italy under Piedmont's Victor Emmanuel II in



<span class="number">68. As prime minister of Prussia, Otto von Bismarck
</span>
(A) instituted important liberal land reforms

(B) largely bypassed parliament to pursue his goal to modernize the military

(C) was totally dependent on the Prussian military

(D) was extremely unpopular among ordinary Germans

(E) became the first German emperor in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian War



<span class="answer">B. Prussia's King William I wished to expand and modernize Prussia's military.
</span>
When Prussia's parliament, led by middle-class liberals fearful of Prussian militarism, blocked the

government's military budget in 1862, William I appointed Otto von Bismarck as prime minister. Bismarck

attempted to get parliament to reverse its decision, but was refused. So, he bypassed Parliament to collect

taxes and reorganized the army without their approval.



<span class="number">69. The Ausgleich, or Compromise, of 1867
</span>
(A) created a loose federation of ethnic states within the Austrian Empire

(B) freed the serfs and eliminated compulsory labor in the Austrian Empire

(C) made Austria part of the North German Confederation

(D) created the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary

(E) destroyed the unity that had been achieved between Austria and Hungary in the 1848

revolutions



<span class="answer">D. In the nineteenth century, ethnic nationalism was endemic in the German-run
</span>
Austrian Empire, particularly in Hungary. Following Austria's defeat by Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War

of 1866, German Austrians negotiated the 1867 Ausgleich, or Compromise, with the Hungarians creating the

dual monarchy of Austria and Hungary. Each state had its own legislature, domestic government, and capital

(Vienna for Austria and Budapest for Hungary), and were united under a single Habsburg monarch, Francis

Joseph.



<span class="number">70. Karl Marx embraced the German philosopher Hegel’s idea of the dialectic, positing that
</span>
(A) all change in history is the result of clashes between directly antagonistic elements

(B) no real changes in society can occur before industrialization

(C) dictatorship is the central political force in all history

(D) political dialogs are the highest form of intellectual thought

(E) reality is spiritual and transcendent



<span class="answer">A. Karl Marx adopted Hegel's conception of the dialectic and applied it to the
</span>
study of economic and social history. Hegel's dialectic posited that all change resulted from a conflict

between opposing and antagonistic elements. Marx did not share Hegel's belief that history was determined

by ideas that manifested themselves in historical forces. Marx's dialectical materialism assumed that an

interaction between opposing and antagonistic material forces determined the course of history. Marx argued

that the course of history would be determined through a class struggle between those who had property and

those who did not.



<span class="number">71. Which of the following statements BEST applies to Charles Darwin and his evolutionary theory?
</span>
(A) His ideas were readily accepted by religious fundamentalists and cultural conservatives.

(B) His works were truly revolutionary and he was the first person to propose a theory of

evolution.

(C) He documented how natural selection governed the adaptation of species to their

environment.

(D) His On the Origin of Species described man’s evolution from animal origins through natural

selection.

(E) His On the Origin of Species was censored and banned by the British government in



<span class="answer">C. Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection
</span>
exhaustively cataloged numerous plants and animals that had evolved over a long period of time from earlier

and simpler forms of life. Darwin theorized that some organisms living in the highly competitive natural

world were more fit than others to survive and reproduce. Since only the "fittest" would survive, their

offspring and the traits they carried would dominate subsequent generations. In The Descent of Man, 1871,

Darwin argued that humanity was also part of the evolutionary process.



<span class="number">72. The dominant literary and artistic movement in the 1850s and 1860s was
</span>
(A) Romanticism

(B) Realism

(C) Positivism

(D) Modernism

(E) Expressionism



<span class="answer">B. The dominant artistic and literary movement of the 1850s and 1860s was
</span>
Realism. Realists rejected the larger-than-life characters and unusual settings of Romanticism, aiming instead



<span class="number">73. By the early twentieth century, Germany began to replace Britain as Europe’s industrial leader largely
</span>
because of

(A) Britain’s careless and radical changes made to its industries

(B) Germany’s pragmatic laissez-faire approach towards industry

(C) Britain’s reliance on cartels to invest large sums of money in new industries

(D) Germany’s fast growing chemical, heavy electrical equipment, and steel industries

(E) the exhaustion of iron and coal resources in the British isles



<span class="answer">D. By the early twentieth century, Germany had begun to replace Britain as
</span>
Europe's leading industrial power on the strength of new manufactures such as chemical and heavy electrical

machinery. German laboratories produced higher-quality artificial chemical dyes and photographic supplies.

By 1910, the Germany produced twice as much steel as Britain did.



<span class="number">74. Some of the most powerful labor unions of the nineteenth-century were found in
</span>
(A) Italy

(B) Germany

(C) France

(D) Italy

(E) Russia



<span class="answer">B. Germany processed some of the most powerful labor unions of the nineteenth
</span>
century. Although trade unions first developed in Great Britain, German unions quickly became very

powerful. By 1914, the German trade union movement was the second largest in Europe. In Germany, about

85 percent of union workers were members of socialist political parties.



<span class="number">75. By 1900, most primary-level European educational systems were
</span>
(A) free and compulsory

(B) expensive to operate and charged high tuition

(C) backward and lacked good teachers

(D) still based on a medieval era curriculum

(E) designed to teach trade skills rather than reading and writing



<span class="answer">A. By the beginning of the twentieth century, most primary-level educational
</span>
systems throughout Europe were free and compulsory. Mass education was a product of the mass society that

evolved from the urban and industrial revolutions. The chief motive for mass education was political. The

increasingly democratic states of Western Europe desired educated voters, and all European nations used

education to instill patriotic and nationalistic attitudes.



<span class="number">76. Louis Napoleon’s Second Empire was brought to an end by
</span>
(A) France’s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War

(B) the emperor’s financial policies

(C) his poor choice of administrators

(D) his defeat by the Austrians

(E) his failure to produce an heir to the imperial throne



<span class="answer">A. France's defeat by Germany in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 ended
</span>
Louis Napoleon's Second Empire. Napoleon III abdicated and obtained exile in England. Some French

wished to establish a monarchy after the fall of the Second Empire, but others desired a republic. Finally, in

1875 an improvised constitution was adopted that established a republican government, France's Third

Republic (the first two were established in 1792 and 1848).



<span class="number">77. A key reason for Germany supplanting England as the industrial leader of Europe was
</span>
(A) British unwillingness to support and encourage formal technical and scientific education

(B) British decentralization of factory production

(C) German use of gas-powered internal combustion engines to drive all factory production

(D) massive German importation of skilled British workers

(E) geography, for German was located on the continent of Europe and England was an island



<span class="answer">A. One of the key reasons that the Germans supplanted the British as the
</span>
industrial leader of Europe was that the British, unlike the Germans, were unwilling to encourage formal

scientific and technical education. In addition, the British were suspicious of innovation and reluctant to

invest in new industries and new technologies.



<span class="number">78. Which of the following statements BEST applies to the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary before
</span>
World War I?

(A) Both Austria and Hungary had working democratic parliamentary systems.

(C) The nationality problem was unresolved and led to strong German and other nationalist

movements.

(D) Prime minister Count Edward von Taafe was ousted in 1893 by the disgruntled Slavic

minorities.

(E) The Austrians and the Hungarians granted independence to the Czechs and Serbs.



<span class="answer">C. On the eve of World War I, the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary still faced
</span>
the unresolved nationality demons that had long disturbed the empire. Ethnic Germans felt threatened outside

of Austria, and the Czechs, Poles, and others still retained their own nationalistic and ethnic aspirations to

govern themselves. World War I would end in the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the

emergence of several ethnic-based states in Eastern Europe.



<span class="number">79. The quantum theory of energy developed by Max Planck raised fundamental questions about
</span>
(A) the structure of stars and their positions

(B) the accepted medieval theories of chemical reaction

(C) the relationship between time and space

(D) the safe transmission of electrical energy to power modern economies

(E) the subatomic realm of the atom and the basic building blocks of the material world



<span class="answer">E. Max Planck's quantum theory of energy raised fundamental questions about
</span>
the subatomic structure of the atom. By 1900, the traditional view that the atom was the basic building block

of the material world was being seriously challenged. Newtonian physics could no longer resolve all of the

scientific issues of the universe.



<span class="number">80. Social Darwinism
</span>
(A) applied Darwin’s theories to the study of society as large

(B) was an effort to explain the problems of society by psychological means

(C) was a scientific sociological explanation of Darwin’s biological ideas

(D) was advocated most strongly by Friedrich Nietzsche

(E) was opposed to concepts of racial superiority



<span class="answer">A. Social Darwinism, which developed in the late nineteenth century, represented
</span>
an attempt to apply Darwin's theories of organic evolution to the study of society at large. The most

prominent of the Social Darwinists was Herbert Spencer, who claimed that societies were organisms that



<span class="number">81. Marie Curie is known for her work with
</span>
(A) DNA

</span>
(A) Louise Michel

(B) Babette Josephs

(C) Emmeline Pankhurst

(D) Octavia Hill

(E) Nancy Astor



<span class="answer">C. Prior to World War, I Emmeline Pankhurst led a radical women's suffrage
</span>
movement in England. In 1903, she established the Women's Social and Political Union with the help of her

daughters Christabel and Sylvia. Pankhurst and her supporters, known as "suffragettes," pelted politicians and

government officials with eggs and vegetables, smashed windows of fashionable department stores, chained

themselves to lamp posts, and went on hunger strikes in jail to dramatize their cause. Although the suffragette

campaign ended with the start of World War I, British women gained the vote after the war.

(C) argued for European Jews to assimilate by embracing Christianity

(D) maintained that living conditions for Jews were better in Eastern Europe than in Western

Europe

(E) attempted to increase the numbers of Jewish Europeans through greater evangelical efforts



<span class="answer">A. In 1896, Theodor Herzl published A Jewish State in which he stated that "the
</span>
Jews who wish it will have their state" in Palestine. However, Palestine was a part of the Ottoman Empire at

that time, and the Ottomans were opposed to Jewish immigration to Palestine. In 1917, the British Foreign

Secretary, Arthur James Balfour, sent a letter to the Jewish leader Lord Rothschild expressing support for a

"national home for the Jewish people" to be located in Palestine. This letter, later known as the Balfour

Declaration, formed the basis for the modern state of Israel. Following the end of World War I, the Ottoman

Empire had dissolved and there was a wave of Jewish immigration to Palestine during the interwar years.



<span class="number">84. The painting in the illustration is an example of
</span>
(A) Romanticism

(B) Realism

(C) Naturalism

(D) Impressionism

(E) Post-Impressionism



<span class="answer">E. Paul Cezanne's Woman with Coffee Pot is an example of Post-Impressionism
</span>
in painting. Post-Impressionists tried to present their inner feelings and perceptions of reality in their painting,

while Impressionists sought to portray the changing effects of light on objects. In this painting, Cezanne

relates the geometric shape of the woman with the geometric shapes of the coffeepot and rectangular door

panels.



<span class="number">85. The Boer War was fought by the British in
</span>
(A) Nigeria

(B) Northern Rhodesia

(C) Kenya

(D) Botswana

(E) South Africa



<span class="answer">E. The Boer War was fought in South Africa between the British and the Boers,
</span>
Afrikaner descendents of seventeenth-century Dutch settlers. Cecil Rhodes and other imperialists pushed

Britain to war when gold and diamonds were discovered on Boer lands. The Boer War lasted from 1899 to

1902; the British defeated the Boers at a considerable cost in blood and treasure.

(D) Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary

(E) America, Britain, and France



<span class="answer">D. After the Franco-Prussian War lead to the unification of Germany, Bismarck
</span>
feared France would seek revenge and the return of the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. Bismarck created a

series of alliances to forestall French retribution. The Triple Alliance included Germany, Italy, and AustriaHungary, although when World War I began in 1914, Italy chose not to join Germany and Austria-Hungary.



<span class="number">87. In the early twentieth century, the primary antagonists in the Balkans were the
</span>
(A) Serbs and Austrians

(B) Russians and French

(C) English and Germans

(D) Serbs and Croats

(E) Ottomans and Germans



<span class="answer">A. In the early twentieth century, Serbs and the Austrians struggled for
</span>
dominance in the Balkans. The decline of the Ottoman Empire in the nineteenth century created a vacuum in

the Balkans. The Austrians expanded into the region, but Serbia, a Slavic state allied with Russia, wanted to

establish a Greater Serbia. The conflicting ambitions of Austria and Serbia ultimately led to World War I.



<span class="number">88. The painting in the illustration is an example of
</span>
(A) Impressionism

(B) Post-Impressionism

(C) Cubism

(D) Abstractionism

(E) Surrealism



<span class="answer">C. The painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon by Pablo Picasso is considered to be
</span>


<span class="number">89. Before the outbreak of World War I, most Europeans were
</span>
(A) highly optimistic and felt material progress would lead to an “earthly paradise”

(B) indifferent towards the future and lived in the present moment

(C) extremely negative, and many people believed that the end of the world was near

(D) happy to let their views be determined by state agencies

(E) focused on their own families and had little or no knowledge about the outside world



<span class="answer">A. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the future seemed bright to
</span>
most Europeans. They expected material progress to create an "earthly paradise," and there was a widespread

belief that science and technology would solve all challenges facing society, including war. Before the

outbreak of World War I, occasional wars were kept localized and mitigated through diplomatic actions.



<span class="number">90. The outbreak of the Great War was GREATLY accelerated by the Schlieffen Plan, which
</span>
(A) promised full-fledged German support for Austrian military actions against Serbia

(B) detailed the Black Hand’s plan for the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria

(C) called for a rapid German invasion France through neutral Belgium before an attack on

Russia

(D) outlined complete Russian mobilization against Germany and Austria-Hungary

(E) justified Germany’s decision to focus most of its military resources in the east against Russia.



<span class="answer">C. The Schlieffen Plan called for a rapid German invasion of France through
</span>
neutral Belgium before turning to fight Russia. The plan was based on the well-founded belief that Russia

would take longer to mobilize its military resources. The Schlieffen Plan was dependent on surprise and rapid

mobilization, making it more likely that Germany would respond with automatic military action in an

international crisis, rather than allowing slow diplomacy to resolve a crisis.



<span class="number">91. The Austrian ultimatum to Serbia precipitated World War I in part because
</span>
(A) Austria had received unconditional German support for military action

(B) England refused to guarantee Serbian territorial integrity

(C) France refused to cancel their alliance with the Habsburgs

(D) Italy renewed its military alliance with Austria

(E) Russia refused to give moral or diplomatic support to the Serbs



<span class="answer">A. The Austrian government seized upon the assassination of Archduke Francis
</span>
Ferdinand in Sarajevo to thwart Serbia's Balkan ambitions. Austria blamed the assassination on Serbia but,

fearing Russia would support their fellow Slavs, sought support from Germany. The German emperor,

William II, gave the Austrians an unconditional promise of "full support." Armed with German support,

Austria placed upon Serbia excessive demands that increased the likelihood of war.



<span class="number">92. Most Europeans believed that the Great War would
</span>
(A) be the same length as the American Civil War

(B) be an exciting and patriotic event that would be over in a few months

(C) last years but would not fundamentally realign the map of Europe

(D) result in the unification of Europe as one centralized and highly militarized government

(E) bring a violent Marxist revolution to Europe



<span class="answer">B. Most Europeans believed that the Great War would be over in a few weeks, or
</span>
months, and supported their government's decision to go to war. Many also believed that the world's

complicated industrial economy necessitated a brief war.



<span class="number">93. The usual tactic of trench warfare was to
</span>
(A) surround the enemy and starve him into submission

(B) use heavy artillery bombardments and then launch direct frontal infantry assaults on welldefended enemy positions

(C) attempt to outflank the enemy through rapid and mobile deployment of troops and cavalry

(D) meet the opposing force on the “field of honor” between the trenches for hand-to-hand

combat

(E) avoid any actual combat with the aim of starving the enemy into surrendering



<span class="answer">B. The development of trench warfare was unexpected by the generals, and the
</span>
only plan that they could devise was to launch a long artillery bombardment to flatten the opponent's barbed

wire and leave the enemy in a state of disorientation and confusion. After "softening up" the enemy, a frontal

infantry assault would be made across no man's land. The tactic invariably failed, given the strength of

opposing machine guns. The cost was millions of lives.



<span class="number">94. The entry of the United States into World War I in April 1917
</span>
(A) gave the nearly-defeated allies a psychological boost

(B) was greatly feared by the German naval staff

(C) was a response to Turkey’s entrance into the war on the side of the Central Powers

(D) put an end to Germany’s use of unlimited submarine warfare

(E) was too late to have any impact upon the events of the war



<span class="answer">A. On April 1917, the United States joined Britain and France in World War I, in
</span>
reaction to the unrestricted German submarine warfare. America's entry gave the Allies an immediate

psychological boost, particularly important after the difficult year Britain and France experienced in



<span class="number">95. In World War I, the Ottoman Empire fought on the side of
</span>
(A) Austria and Germany

(B) Russia

(C) Italy

(D) France and Britain

(E) America



<span class="answer">A. When World War I began in August 1914, the Triple Alliance consisted of
</span>
Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. However, Italy refused to join the Central Powers and entered the war

on the side of Britain and France. In 1914, the Ottoman Empire joined with Germany and Austria-Hungary,

partially because of Russian and British threats to Ottoman territories.



<span class="number">96. Women workers during World War I succeeded by
</span>
(A) winning the right to vote immediately following the war

(B) gaining wage equality with men by the end of the war

(C) achieving permanent job security in the once male-dominated workplace

(D) participating in all industries except for textiles

(E) wrestling corporate control of firms from warring men



<span class="answer">A. By necessity, women played a major economic role in World War I, replacing
</span>
male workers who were in the military. However, they received lower wages than men and often lost their

jobs at war's end as soldiers returned to their old jobs. However, participation in the war effort helped women

to gain the vote. British women gained the vote in January 1918, with German and Austrian women



<span class="number">97. The Russian army’s woes during World War I included all of the following EXCEPT
</span>
(A) not enough manpower

(B) poor military leadership

(C) lack of modern armaments

(D) great losses of men in battle

(E) disastrous political leadership



<span class="answer">A. When World War I began, Russia was not prepared. Although it had the
</span>
largest population in Europe and could provide enough soldiers for its armies, Russia lacked modern

armaments and military leaders, and was governed by the inept Tsar Nicholas II. By early 1917, the Russian

army had suffered three million dead and eight million total casualties.



<span class="number">98. After the Bolshevik seized power in November 1917, Lenin
</span>
(A) accelerated the war effort against Germany

(B) returned the control of factories to their rightful owners

(C) ratified the redistribution of land to starving peasants

(D) successfully managed to reestablish the Duma under socialist control

(E) inaugurated a worldwide Marxist revolution



<span class="answer">C. After the Bolsheviks seized power in November 1917, Lenin nationalized all
</span>
land and gave it to rural soviets. This ratified past peasant land seizures and assured that peasants would

continue to support the Bolsheviks against their former landlords. The Duma was quickly dismissed, and

Lenin withdrew Russia from the war against Germany in early 1918 as civil war broke out between the Reds

and Whites.



<span class="number">99. All of the following states were created out of the Austro-Hungarian Empire following World War I
</span>
EXCEPT

(A) Austria

(B) Hungary

(C) Poland

(D) Czechoslovakia

(E) All of the above



<span class="answer">C. When the Austro-Hungarian Empire disintegrated after World War I, several
</span>
new states emerged from its wreckage, including Austria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. Poland had

disappeared from the maps of Europe in the eighteenth century but was reconstituted after the war from

mostly Russian but also German territory.



<span class="number">100. The Treaty of Versailles
</span>
(A) fully absolved the Central Powers of guilt for causing the war

(B) created Wilson’s United Nations

(C) forced Germany to acknowledge “war guilt” and pay reparations

(D) created a system to dismantle the Turkish Empire

(E) brought a lasting peace to Europe



<span class="answer">C. The Treaty of Versailles included Article 231, the so-called War Guilt
</span>
Clause, which required that Germany accept responsibility for starting World War I. Since Germany was

responsible for starting the war, it was obligated to pay reparations for war damage. Most Germans

considered the Versailles Treaty to be unfair, and during the 1920s and 1930s, it was used by Adolph Hitler

to rally political support.



<span class="number">101. The scene would have been a common sight in
</span>
(A) France after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871

(B) Russia in the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917

(C) Germany in the early 1920s

(D) the United States during the Great Depression

(E) Great Britain during the German Blitz of 1940



<span class="answer">C. In 1922, the German government faced enormous economic difficulties and
</span>
could no longer pay war reparations. France responded by occupying the Ruhr valley and seizing mines and

factories in compensation. The German government responded by printing more money, causing

hyperinflation, economic collapse, and the worthless currency shown in the photograph.



<span class="number">102. Which of the following was a MAJOR cause of the Great Depression?
</span>
(A) European governments were too involved in their own economies.

(B) America recalled its loans from European markets.

(C) Underproduction led to high prices for agricultural goods in eastern and central Europe.

(D) The League of Nations couldn’t produce effective economic policies for different economic

regions.

(E) German economic difficulties reduced the size of European markets.



<span class="answer">B. Much of Europe's prosperity between 1924 and 1929 rested on massive loans
</span>
made to Germany by American banks under the Dawes Plan. American private loans helped to stabilize the

German economy and enabled Germany to make its war reparation payments. The crash of the American

stock market in October 1929 caused panicky American investors to withdraw their loans and investments in

Europe, causing European economies to collapse like a house of cards.



<span class="number">103. Mussolini’s Fascist dictatorship
</span>
(A) lacked a secret police force

(B) sponsored highly popular and well attended Fascist youth organizations

(C) was primarily aimed at aiding the workers and peasants

(D) never created the degree of totalitarian control found in Russia and Germany in the 1930s

(E) advanced women’s rights and encouraged them to take industrial jobs



<span class="answer">D. Although Mussolini's repressive fascist dictatorship used propaganda and
</span>
created numerous fascist organizations, it never achieved the degree of totalitarian control found in Soviet

Russia or Nazi Germany. The armed forces, Church, monarchy, and other pre-fascist organizations were

never fully absorbed into the Fascist state, and workers and peasants were largely left alone. Mussolini also

granted the Catholic Church its own sovereign territory in the heart of Rome—Vatican City.



<span class="number">104. In Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler
</span>
(A) outlined his plan to take power through a massive rebellion and violent revolution

(B) told his life story and detailed his ideology of racism, Aryan supremacy, and anti-Semitism

(C) avoided discussing his anti-Semitism for political reasons

(D) showed German politicians that he was a dangerous extremist

(E) was unable to reach German readers because of a ban imposed on the book



<span class="answer">B. Hitler wrote his autobiography Mein Kampf, or My Struggle, while in prison
</span>
for the failed Beer Hall Putsch of November



<span class="number">105. The photograph in the illustration is a scene from
</span>
(A) Moscow in November, 1917

(B) Berlin in November, 1938

(C) Warsaw in September, 1939

(D) London in August, 1940

(E) Dresden in February, 1945



<span class="answer">B. The photograph shows a boy cleaning up broken glass and other debris in
</span>
Berlin the morning after Kristallnacht in November



<span class="number">106. The only Eastern European nation to maintain political democracy throughout the 1930’s was
</span>
(A) Bulgaria

(B) Czechoslovakia

(C) Poland

(D) Hungary

(E) Yugoslavia



<span class="answer">B. By the beginning of the 1930s, the only remaining Eastern Europe
</span>
parliamentary democracy was Czechoslovakia. In the 1920s, several states in Eastern Europe shifted to

authoritarian governments. A military regime took power in Poland in 1925 and royal dictatorships were

imposed in Bulgaria (1923) and Yugoslavia (1929).



<span class="number">107. The collectivization of agriculture under Stalin was characterized by the
</span>
(A) spread of famine caused by peasant hoarding and the slaughter of livestock

(B) cooperation of kulaks with peasant soviets

(C) gradual establishment of larger and more efficient collective farms

(D) rapid improvement of the financial well-being of peasant farmers

(E) establishment of a widely praised system of large farms granting autonomy to peasant

farmers



<span class="answer">A. Stalin's collectivization policy eliminated private farms and moved farming
</span>
families onto large collective farms. The peasants resisted by hoarding crops and slaughtering their livestock,

causing a massive famine. By 1934, 26 million family farms were consolidated into 250,000 collectives, and

10 million peasants had died from the government-created famine.



<span class="number">108. The MOST famous of the Surrealistic painters was
</span>
(A) Arnold Schonberg

(B) Salvador Dali

(C) Walter Gropius

(D) Wassily Kandinsky

(E) Pablo Picasso



<span class="answer">B. Surrealism was an important artistic movement of the interwar years.
</span>
Surrealists sought to express a reality that went beyond the material world of the senses. Their paintings were

often inspired by the world of the Freudian unconscious: dreams, nightmares, and fantasies. The most famous

of the Surrealist painters was Salvador Dali, known for using recognizable objects removed from their normal

context, such as the melting timepieces of The Persistence of Memory.



<span class="number">109. The physicist Walter Heisenberg was MOST noted for
</span>
(A) proposing that uncertainty was at the bottom of all physical laws

(B) being part of the first team to split the atom

(C) resurrecting the scientific predictability of classical physics

(D) the development of the atomic bomb

(E) his quantum theory



<span class="answer">A. The revolution in physics begun by Einstein and Planck continued into the
</span>
interwar years. In classical Newtonian physics, it was believed that all phenomena could be predicted if the

appropriate variables could be measured. Walter Heisenberg disagreed with such predictability. No one could

determine the path of an electron because the very act of observing the electron with light affected the

electron's location. Heisenberg undermined confidence in the predictability of physics by proposing that

uncertainty existed at some level of all physical laws.



<span class="number">110. The Munich Conference
</span>
(A) was applauded by Winston Churchill as a “wise and noble agreement”

(B) established that German desires for the Sudetenland necessitated war with the Western

powers

(C) was criticized by Winston Churchill as a tragic outcome of appeasement

(D) represented a severe setback for Hitler

(E) saved Czechoslovakia from destruction and Europe from another long and painful war



<span class="answer">C. In 1938, Hitler threatened war unless Czechoslovakia ceded the largely
</span>
ethnic German territory of the Sudetenland to Germany. At Munich, in September, the British Prime

Minister, Neville Chamberlain, and the French Premier, agreed to all of Hitler's demands. In order to avoid

war, Britain and France resorted to what became known as a strategy of "appeasement," or giving in to all

demands. When Chamberlain returned to England, he claimed the agreement guaranteed "peace for our

time." Winston Churchill, however, called the Munich agreement "a disaster of the first magnitude."



<span class="number">111. Immediately after the fall of Poland,
</span>
(A) France and Britain declared war and began an offensive against Germany

(B) France and Britain continued to appease Hitler

(C) the Soviet Union declared war on Nazi Germany

(D) Germany turned on its Russian allies

(E) France and Britain declared war, but remained relatively inactive militarily



<span class="answer">E. On September 1, 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland, using Blitzkrieg, or
</span>
"lightening war" tactics. France and Britain declared war against Germany on September 3, but they did not

take the offensive militarily, hoping instead that attrition and an economic blockade might prevent further

military action by Hitler. The waiting of the winter of 1939–1940 was referred to as the "phony war." Hitler

resumed the offensive in the West in April, and by the end of June most of the nations of Western Europe,

except Britain, had fallen under the Nazi yoke.



<span class="number">112. Japanese expansion in the 1930s was fueled primarily by
</span>
(A) an expanding population and severe lack of natural resources on the island nation

(B) an intense hatred for the Chinese and Chinese culture

(C) a desire by ruling military leaders to test their newly developed and newly organized armed

forces

(D) a belief by many Japanese that they were a “master race” destined to rule all of Asia

(E) a fear of an imminent invasion of Japan by the United States.



<span class="answer">A. Japan had risen become a world power in the late nineteenth and early
</span>
twentieth century by defeating China and Russia. By the early 1930s, Japan was experiencing internal

tensions resulting from an expanding population (from 30 million in 1870 to 80 million by 1937) and a severe



<span class="number">113. Hitler’s “Final Solution” to the Jewish problem called for
</span>
(A) the extermination of all Jews

(B) the forced deportation of the Jews to Madagascar

(C) the resettlement of Jews in ghettos, isolated from other Europeans

(D) breeding “Jewish genes” out of the Jewish population itself

(E) the expulsion of all German Jews to Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe



<span class="answer">A. Hitler's "Final Solution" to the Jewish problem called for the extermination
</span>
of all Jews. At the beginning of 1939, Nazi policy promoted the "emigration" of German Jews out of

Germany. With the onset of war in September, it was suggested that all Jews be shipped to the island of

Madagascar, off the east coast of Africa. Instead, the decision was made to exterminate the Jews, first by

death squads, and then in specially constructed death camps such as Auschwitz-Birkenau, using ovens,

poison gas, and other industrialized methods of mass murder.



<span class="number">114. The official reason for dropping atomic bombs on Japan was to
</span>
(A) punish Japan for Pearl Harbor

(B) test the new weapon to see how powerful it was

(C) conserve conventional explosives that were of short supply in the United States

(D) end the war quickly and avoid hundreds of thousands of future American casualties

(E) demonstrate the might of American nuclear weapons to the Soviet Union



<span class="answer">D. The official reason for dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
</span>
in August 1945 was to save both American and Japanese lives. President Harry Truman and his advisors

feared that an invasion of the Japanese home islands by American forces could cost a million American lives.



<span class="number">115. Which of the following factors contributed MOST to the development of the Cold War in Eastern
</span>
Europe?

(A) The withdrawal of victorious Russian armies from lands conquered during the campaign

against Nazism

(B) Raids by American troops pursuing German Nazi war criminals into areas of the former

Third Reich under Russian control

(C) Stalin’s desire to establish a buffer zone of pro-Soviet governments in the countries of

Eastern Europe

(D) The domination of Austrian and Italian politics by popular pro-Communist parties

(E) The American demand that the Soviet Union abandon communism and replace it with

capitalism



<span class="answer">C. As World War II came to an end, the Allies began to disagree about the
</span>
future of Europe and the world. One of the areas of greatest disagreement was over the future of the Eastern

European countries. The United States and Great Britain advocated self-determination and democracy for the

newly liberated states, but the Soviet Union's Stalin demanded the creation of Soviet-friendly buffer states

against the possibility of Western attack.



<span class="number">116. The Common Market was
</span>
(A) primarily a military alliance of certain European countries

(B) a forum of European nations founded to solve social problems

(C) established to improve member economies and promote free trade between them

(D) started for cultural reasons to combat American materialism

(E) less than successful because of the opposition of France’s Charles de Gaulle



<span class="answer">C. In 1951, France, West Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and
</span>
Italy established the European Coal and Steel Community with the aim of creating a common market for

those two items by eliminating trade barriers. In 1957, those same nations created the European Economic

Community (EEC), known as the Common Market. Established for economic reasons, the Common Market

eliminated trade barriers between the nations and created a large free-trade area.



<span class="number">117. Which of the following American Presidents dubbed the Soviet Union the “evil empire” and launched
</span>
the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)?

(A) Richard Nixon

(B) Jimmy Carter

(C) Ronald Reagan

(D) Bill Clinton

(E) George Bush



<span class="answer">C. Ronald Reagan, a fervent anticommunist, was elected president of the United
</span>
States in



<span class="number">118. The economic problems of the United States in the 1970s are referred to as
</span>
(A) inflation

(B) deflation

(C) depression

(D) hyperinflation

(E) stagflation



<span class="answer">E. Under the presidential administrations of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, the
</span>
United States suffered a severe economic stagnation. The crisis was caused by a 400% increase in oil prices

by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Uncharacteristically, high inflation combined

with high unemployment to produce the new economic phenomenon known as "stagflation."



<span class="number">119. The philosophical doctrine of existentialism, which emphasized the role of personal choice and
</span>
responsibility in shaping an individual’s destiny, was

(A) dominant in the universities of Great Britain and the United States

(B) concerned with logic and the theory of knowledge

(C) totally at odds with the confidence and prosperity of the post-war world

(D) best expressed in the works of the French writers Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre

(E) accepted by liberal Christian churches and Jewish synagogues but not by more conservative

faiths



<span class="answer">D. Existentialism was the result of two world wars and the consequent
</span>
breakdown of traditional values. Post-World War II existentialism was best expressed by the French authors

Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre. They argued that in a universe without God, humans had no preordained

destiny and struggled to find meaning alone. Life was without transcendental meaning or purpose. Faced with

despair and depression, Camus believed humans could find salvation only in themselves and let their own

actions define themselves: "man is nothing else but what he makes of himself."



<span class="number">120. The photograph in the illustration shows
</span>
(A) anti-Yeltsin demonstrators in the Soviet Union

(B) food riots in Bosnia-Herzegovina

(C) a counter-culture “love-in” at Woodstock

(D) the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989

(E) the confused aftermath of September 11, 2001



<span class="answer">D. Popular unrest and an economic decline led to mass demonstrations in
</span>
Communist East Germany and to sympathy demonstrations in West Germany. Bowing to the inevitable, the

East German government opened the entire border with the West. The Berlin Wall, the most famous symbol

of the Cold War, "fell" to democracy and a massive celebration ensued. The infamous wall was demolished

into millions of pieces that became souvenirs.</pre> <!-- Use the safe filter to render HTML -->
