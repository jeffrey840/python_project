      "responsible for starting the war, it was obligated to pay reparations for war damage. Most Germans\n",

      "(A) European governments were too involved in their own economies.\n",
      "(B) America recalled its loans from European markets.\n",

      "made to Germany by American banks under the Dawes Plan. American private loans helped to stabilize the\n",

      "Russia or Nazi Germany. The armed forces, Church, monarchy, and other pre-fascist organizations were\n",
