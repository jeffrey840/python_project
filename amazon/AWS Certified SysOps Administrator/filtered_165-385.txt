Question #: 182
Topic #: 1
[All AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate Questions]
A SysOps administrator is investigating a company’s web application for performance problems. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances that are in an Auto Scaling group. The application receives large traffic increases at random times throughout the day. During periods of rapid traffic increases, the Auto Scaling group is not adding capacity fast enough. As a result, users are experiencing poor performance.

The company wants to minimize costs without adversely affecting the user experience when web traffic surges quickly. The company needs a solution that adds more capacity to the Auto Scaling group for larger traffic increases than for smaller traffic increases.

How should the SysOps administrator configure the Auto Scaling group to meet these requirements?
A. Create a simple scaling policy with settings to make larger adjustments in capacity when the system is under heavy load.
B. Create a step scaling policy with settings to make larger adjustments in capacity when the system is under heavy load.
C. Create a target tracking scaling policy with settings to make larger adjustments in capacity when the system is under heavy load.
D. Use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks. Adjust the Auto Scaling group’s maximum number of instances after every scaling event.

A company is implementing a monitoring solution that is based on machine learning. The monitoring solution consumes Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) events that are generated by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. The monitoring solution provides detection of anomalous behavior such as unanticipated scaling events and is configured as an EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) API destination.

During initial testing, the company discovers that the monitoring solution is not receiving events. However, Amazon CloudWatch is showing that the EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) rule is being invoked. A SysOps administrator must implement a solution to retrieve client error details to help resolve this issue.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational effort?
A. Create an EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) archive for the event pattern to replay the events. Increase the logging on the monitoring solution. Use replay to invoke the monitoring solution. Examine the error details.
B. Add an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue as a dead-letter queue for the target. Process the messages in the dead-letter queue to retrieve error details.
C. Create a second EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) rule for the same event pattern to target an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to invoke the monitoring solution and to record the results to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Examine the errors in the logs.

[All AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate Questions]
A company website contains a web tier and a database tier on AWS. The web tier consists of Amazon EC2 instances that run in an Auto Scaling group across two Availability Zones. The database tier runs on an Amazon RDS for MySQL Multi-AZ DB instance. The database subnet network ACLs are restricted to only the web subnets that need access to the database. The web subnets use the default network ACL with the default rules.

The company's operations team has added a third subnet to the Auto Scaling group configuration. After an Auto Scaling event occurs, some users report that they intermittently receive an error message. The error message states that the server cannot connect to the database. The operations team has confirmed that the route tables are correct and that the required ports are open on all security groups.

Which combination of actions should a SysOps administrator take so that the web servers can communicate with the DB instance? (Choose two.)
A. On the default ACL, create inbound Allow rules of type TCP with the ephemeral port range and the source as the database subnets.
B. On the default ACL, create outbound Allow rules of type MySQL/Aurora (3306). Specify the destinations as the database subnets.
C. On the network ACLs for the database subnets, create an inbound Allow rule of type MySQL/Aurora (3306). Specify the source as the third web subnet.
D. On the network ACLs for the database subnets, create an outbound Allow rule of type TCP with the ephemeral port range and the destination as the third web subnet.

A company runs an application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The EC2 instances are in an Auto Scaling group. The application sometimes becomes slow and unresponsive. Amazon CloudWatch metrics show that some EC2 instances are experiencing high CPU load.

A SysOps administrator needs to create a CloudWatch dashboard that can automatically display CPU metrics of all the EC2 instances. The metrics must include new instances that are launched as part of the Auto Scaling group.

What should the SysOps administrator do to meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way?
A. Create a CloudWatch dashboard. Use activity notifications from the Auto Scaling group to invoke a custom AWS Lambda function. Use the Lambda function to update the CloudWatch dashboard to monitor the CPUUtilization metric for the new instance IDs.
B. Create a CloudWatch dashboard. Run a custom script on each EC2 instance to stream the CPU utilization to the dashboard.
C. Use CloudWatch metrics explorer to filter by the aws:autoscaling:groupName tag and to create a visualization for the CPUUtilization metric. Add the visualization to a CloudWatch dashboard.
D. Use CloudWatch metrics explorer to filter by instance state and to create a visualization for the CPUUtilization metric. Add the visualization to a CloudWatch dashboard.

A company has a large on-premises tape backup solution. The company has started to use AWS Storage Gateway. The company created a Tape Gateway to replace the existing on-premises hardware. The company's backup engineer noticed that some of the backup jobs that were supposed to write to AWS failed to run because of a "Not Enough Space" error.

The company does not want these failures to happen again. The company also wants to consistently have enough tape available on AWS.

What is the MOST operationally efficient way for a SysOps administrator to meet these requirements?
A. Create an AWS Lambda function that runs on an hourly basis and checks how many tapes have available space. If the available tapes are below a certain threshold, provision more.
B. Install the Amazon CloudWatch agent on the on-premises system. Push the log files to a CloudWatch log group. Create an AWS Lambda function that creates more tapes when the "Not Enough Space" error appears. Create a metric filter and a metric alarm that launches the Lambda function.
C. Create an additional Tape Gateway with its own set of tapes. Configure Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send a notification to the backup engineer if the tapes that are associated with the primary Tape Gateway do not have available space.
D. Configure tape auto-create on the Tape Gateway. In the auto-create settings, configure a minimum number of tapes, an appropriate barcode prefix, and a tape pool.

A company has users that deploy Amazon EC2 instances that have more disk performance capacity than is required. A SysOps administrator needs to review all Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that are associated with the instances and create cost optimization recommendations based on IOPS and throughput.

What should the SysOps administrator do to meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way?
A. Use the monitoring graphs in the EC2 console to view metrics for EBS volumes. Review the consumed space against the provisioned space on each volume. Identify any volumes that have low utilization.
B. Stop the EC2 instances from the EC2 console. Change the EC2 instance type for Amazon EBS-optimized. Start the EC2 instances.
C. Opt in to AWS Compute Optimizer. Allow sufficient time for metrics to be gathered. Review the Compute Optimizer findings for EBS volumes.
D. Install the fio tool onto the EC2 instances and create a .cfg file to approximate the required workloads. Use the benchmark results to gauge whether the provisioned EBS volumes are of the most appropriate type.
