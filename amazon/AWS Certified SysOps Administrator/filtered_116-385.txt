Question #: 125
Topic #: 1
[All AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate Questions]
A company hosts a web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances are in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. The application is accessed with a public URL.

A SysOps administrator needs to implement a monitoring solution that checks the availability of the application and follows the same routes and actions as a customer. The SysOps administrator must receive a notification if less than 95% of the monitoring runs find no errors.

Which solution will meet these requirements?
A. Create an Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics canary with a script that follows customer routes. Schedule the canary to run on a recurring schedule. Create a CloudWatch alarm that publishes a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the SuccessPercent metric is less than 95%.
B. Create Amazon Route 53 health checks that monitor the availability of the endpoint. Create Amazon CloudWatch alarms that publish a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the HealthCheckPercentageHealthy metric is less than 95%.
C. Create a single AWS Lambda function to check whether the endpoints are available for each customer path. Schedule the Lambda function by using Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events). Configure the Lambda function to publish a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when an endpoint returns an error.
D. Create an AWS Lambda function for each customer path to check whether that specific endpoint is available. Schedule the Lambda functions by using Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events). Configure each Lambda function to publish a custom metric to Amazon CloudWatch for the endpoint status. Create CloudWatch alarms based on each custom metric to publish a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when an alarm is in the ALARM state.
