Question #: 83
Topic #: 1
[All AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate Questions]
A company analyzes sales data for its customers. Customers upload files to one of the company's Amazon S3 buckets, and a message is posted to an Amazon
Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue that contains the object Amazon Resource Name (ARN). An application that runs on an Amazon EC2 instance polls the queue and processes the messages. The processing time depends on the size of the file.
Customers are reporting delays in the processing of their files. A SysOps administrator decides to configure Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling as the first step. The
SysOps administrator creates an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that is based on the existing EC2 instance. The SysOps administrator also creates a launch template that references the AMI.
How should the SysOps administrator configure the Auto Scaling policy to improve the response time?
A. Add several different instance sizes in the launch template. Create an Auto Scaling policy based on the ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible metric to select the size of the instance based on the number of messages in the queue.
B. Create an Auto Scaling policy based on the ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed metric to scale the number of instances based on the number of messages in the queue that have been delayed.
C. Create a custom metric based on the ASGAverageCPUUtilization metric and the GroupPendingInstances metric from the Auto Scaling group. Modify the application to calculate the metric and post the metric to Amazon CloudWatch once each minute. Create an Auto Scaling policy based on this metric to scale the number of instances.
D. Create a custom metric based on the ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible metric and the number of instances in the InService state in the Auto Scaling group. Modify the application to calculate the metric and post the metric to Amazon CloudWatch once each minute. Create an Auto Scaling policy based on this metric to scale the number of instances.
