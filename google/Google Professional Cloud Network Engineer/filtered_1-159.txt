Your company just completed the acquisition of Altostrat (a current GCP customer). Each company has a separate organization in GCP and has implemented a custom DNS solution. Each organization will retain its current domain and host names until after a full transition and architectural review is done in one year.
These are the assumptions for both GCP environments.
"¢ Each organization has enabled full connectivity between all of its projects by using Shared VPC.

"¢ There are no prefix overlaps between the two organizations.
"¢ Both organizations already have firewall rules that allow all inbound and outbound traffic from the 10.0.0.0/8 address space.
"¢ Neither organization has Interconnects to their on-premises environment.
You want to integrate networking and DNS infrastructure of both organizations as quickly as possible and with minimal downtime.

Your company has defined a resource hierarchy that includes a parent folder with subfolders for each department. Each department defines their respective project and VPC in the assigned folder and has the appropriate permissions to create Google Cloud firewall rules. The VPCs should not allow traffic to flow between them. You need to block all traffic from any source, including other VPCs, and delegate only the intra-VPC firewall rules to the respective departments. What should you do?
A. Create a VPC firewall rule in each VPC to block traffic from any source, with priority 0.
B. Create a VPC firewall rule in each VPC to block traffic from any source, with priority 1000.
C. Create two hierarchical firewall policies per department's folder with two rules in each: a high-priority rule that matches traffic from the private CIDRs assigned to the respective VPC and sets the action to allow, and another lower-priority rule that blocks traffic from any other source.
D. Create two hierarchical firewall policies per department's folder with two rules in each: a high-priority rule that matches traffic from the private CIDRs assigned to the respective VPC and sets the action to goto_next, and another lower-priority rule that blocks traffic from any other source.
