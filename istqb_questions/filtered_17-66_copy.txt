You are performing a review of your colleague's test cases based on the following test basis document:

The Test Cases are as follows:
TC1. Success `" valid 'User Name' and 'Password'; Customer Menu displayed
TC2. Failure `" 'User Name' field has blank entry; Error Number 12 displayed
TC3. Failure `" 'User Id' entered does not exist on database (i.e. unregistered user); Error Number 23 displayed
TC4. Failure `" 'Password' entered does not match user's password on database; Error Number 24 displayed
You are guided by the following checklist in your review:
C1. There must be one test case to cover success
C2. There must be one test case for each error path (e.g. validation failure)
C3. Each test case must use terminology consistent with the test basis document (field names, error numbering, etc.)
Record a separate defect for each missing test case (checklist items C1 and C2) and for each test case that does not meet checklist item C3.
How many defects should you record?
A. 1.
B. 2.
C. 3.
D. 4.

Which of the following BEST describes checklist-based testing?
A. An approach to testing whereby the testers dynamically design and execute tests based on their knowledge, exploration of the test item and the results of previous tests.
