Important Facts:

- Political parties have various levels of organization: precinct, county, and state. Each level has specific roles and responsibilities.
- The precinct chair is elected by precinct voters, serves as a party organizer, and oversees precinct conventions, among other responsibilities.
- County chairs are elected by voters and preside over the county executive committee. They handle primary logistics, appoint election judges, and certify nominees to the state.
- State conventions select the state chair, who leads the state executive committee, certifies primary winners, and organizes party activities.
- Political parties serve three main functions: the party in the electorate (citizen identification with parties), the party as an organization (formal party structure and activities), and the party in government (influence on policies and governance).
- These functions shape voters' views, influence party activities, recruit candidates, and try to influence primary election outcomes.
