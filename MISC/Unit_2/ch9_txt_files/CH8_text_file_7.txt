Here are the important facts from the provided text:

1. **Judicial Campaign Contributions and Bias Concerns**: The U.S. Supreme Court case Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., Inc. highlighted potential conflicts of interest when litigants significantly influence judges' elections. The case involved a substantial donation by the chairman of a coal company to finance the election of a new justice who later ruled in favor of the company. This raised concerns about bias due to significant financial contributions. [Keyword: Judicial bias]

2. **Influence of Campaign Contributions on Judicial Decisions**: Large contributions from both plaintiff and defense attorneys to judicial campaigns have raised questions about conflicts of interest. This practice has led to concerns about attorneys appearing before judges to whom they have contributed substantial sums of money. [Keywords: Campaign contributions, Conflicts of interest]

3. **Role of Contributors in Judicial Elections**: Lawyers, particularly corporate defense and lobbying firms, are the primary contributors in judicial campaigns, significantly influencing the outcomes. Organizations like Texans for Lawsuit Reform (TLR), which align with the Republican Party, have major influence and seek to limit liability suits. Plaintiffs' attorneys, representing injured parties, contribute to other races rather than directly supporting Democratic judicial candidates.

4. **Judicial Campaign Fairness Act**: The act, passed in 1995 by the Texas Legislature, imposes limits on the amounts that candidates for statewide judicial positions can receive from individuals, law firms, and political action committees. However, outside groups can independently spend unlimited amounts advocating for or against judicial candidates. [Keyword: Judicial Campaign Fairness Act]

5. **Lack of Diversity on the Bench**: The current partisan election system in Texas has been criticized for leading to limited ethnic, racial, and gender diversity among judges. Anglos make up a significant percentage of judges compared to their representation in the population, while minorities and women are underrepresented. [Keyword: Lack of diversity in judiciary]

These keywords can assist in finding specific information within the text regarding concerns about judicial bias, the influence of campaign contributions, the Judicial Campaign Fairness Act, and the lack of diversity in Texas's judicial system.
