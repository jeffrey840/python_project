1. **Jury Selection and Challenges**: There are two types of challenges during jury selection - challenges for cause and peremptory challenges. Challenges for cause can be based on any factor that could indicate bias or prevent a fair decision. Peremptory challenges allow removal of a juror without providing a reason, but limitations exist when solely based on ethnicity, race, or sex. Each side is granted five to fifteen peremptory challenges depending on the case. [Keywords: Challenges for cause, Peremptory challenges]

2. **Grand Jury**: Comprises twelve members in Texas and determines if there's enough evidence to proceed to trial. They issue indictments based on sufficient evidence. The vote of at least nine out of twelve grand jurors is needed to indict in Texas. However, they don't determine guilt or innocence; instead, they hear various cases during a fixed term. Grand juries rely heavily on the district attorney's advice, and typically return true bills in about 95% of cases. [Keywords: Grand Jury]

3. **Judicial Selection in Texas**: Texas uses partisan elections to select judges for most courts. Some other states employ methods such as appointment by governors or legislatures and nonpartisan elections. The goal of partisan elections is public accountability and control over the courts, allowing judges to be elected on party tickets. [Keywords: Judicial selection, Partisan elections]
