These keywords can help locate specific information within the text when needed.
Here are the important facts from the provided text:

[Keywords: Challenges in current system, overwhelming judicial elections]

3. **Issues with Partisan Identity in Elections**: Partisan identity becomes the primary criteria for selecting judges, even though most judges, especially at the trial level, handle mundane and personal cases rather than contentious social or constitutional issues.
