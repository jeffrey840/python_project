Here are the important facts from the provided text:

1. **Judicial Selection in Texas**: Texas historically elected judges to ensure they were respected and responsive to the local community. However, the state's current system involves electing judges in contested, partisan elections, resulting in voters being asked to choose judges in a complex system with little information.

2. **Challenges in the Current System**: Wallace B. Jefferson, former Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court, criticizes the current system as being stacked against voters. He notes that voters, especially in counties like Harris, face an overwhelming number of judicial elections with limited information, leading them to vote primarily based on partisan identity. [Keywords: Challenges in current system, overwhelming judicial elections]

3. **Issues with Partisan Identity in Elections**: Partisan identity becomes the primary criteria for selecting judges, even though most judges, especially at the trial level, handle mundane and personal cases rather than contentious social or constitutional issues. This reliance on partisan identity leads to good and bad judges being swept out of office based solely on their party affiliation. [Keywords: Partisan identity, judging competence]

4. **Proposed Merit-Based System**: Wallace B. Jefferson proposes a merit selection panel to recommend accomplished lawyers for judgeships. These judges would be appointed by the governor and subject to nonpartisan retention elections, aiming to prioritize competence and integrity over partisanship and name recognition.
