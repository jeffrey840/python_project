Here are the important facts from the provided text:

1. **Nonpartisan Elections**: In some states, including Texas, nonpartisan elections exist for selecting judges. However, although party labels might be omitted from ballots, candidates often have affiliations with political parties and receive support from these parties despite nonpartisan systems. Critics argue that removing party labels conceals vital information about the candidates' general ideology and judicial decision-making patterns. [Keyword: Nonpartisan elections]

2. **Merit Plan (Missouri Plan)**: Around one-third of states combine the advantages of election (accountability) with appointment (independence) by using the merit plan. This system aims to select judges based on merit or quality, avoiding direct partisan campaigns. A judicial commission nominates candidates for appointment by the governor, and appointees later face retention elections. [Keyword: Merit plan, Missouri plan]

3. **Voter Knowledge and Partisanship**: Voters often lack knowledge about judicial candidates in Texas, leading them to rely heavily on candidates' partisan affiliations when voting in elections. Party affiliation is a common cue for voters, especially in the absence of other information about candidates. In Texas, Republican candidates have historically dominated judicial elections, but there have been recent shifts, with Democrats gaining positions in some appellate courts. Critics note that voting solely based on a candidate's political party can lead to controversial results. [Keywords: Voter knowledge, Partisanship]

4. **Campaign Contributions and Fairness**: Campaign spending in judicial races, particularly in Texas, has significantly increased. Concerns revolve around the dominance of Republican candidates in campaign contributions, raising questions about fairness, advantages of incumbency, and whether justice can be influenced or "bought" through these contributions.
