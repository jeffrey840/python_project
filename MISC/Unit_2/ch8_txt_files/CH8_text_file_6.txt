Important facts from the text:

1. **Special Sessions & Governor's Power**:
   - The Texas governor has exclusive power to call special sessions and decide the legislative subjects to be addressed during these sessions. Although the governor determines topics, the legislature can consider nonlegislative subjects like confirmations, resolutions, and impeachment, even if not included in the governor's call.
   - Special sessions are limited to a duration of 30 days, but the governor can call them as frequently as desired.
   - Governor Abbott effectively used special sessions in 2021 to address election reform. Democrats engaged in a quorum break during the regular session to block Republican-authored election reform legislation. Abbott called multiple special sessions to address this issue until the legislation (Senate Bill 1) passed and was signed into law.

2. **Bargaining Power & Dilemmas**:
   - Calling a special session can create dilemmas for the governor, as various interest groups may oppose or support certain legislative topics or the calling of a special session.
   - The governor uses special sessions as a bargaining tool, leveraging inclusion or exclusion of specific policy proposals to negotiate concessions or support from legislators and interest groups.
