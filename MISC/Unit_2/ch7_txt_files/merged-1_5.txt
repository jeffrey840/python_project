Important facts from the text:

- Districts in Texas should be equal in population, redrawn after each decennial census to reflect population changes and maintain approximately equal districts.
- Republicans, having control in the House and Senate after the 2020 elections, were able to agree on district maps favoring their party.
- Failure by the legislature to redistrict leads to the Legislative Redistricting Board stepping in; members include the lieutenant governor, the speaker of the house, the attorney general, the comptroller, and the commissioner of the General Land Office.
- Malapportionment, historically present, was outlawed by U.S. Supreme Court decisions like Reynolds v. Sims, enforcing "one person, one vote" and mandating reapportionment after every census.
- Gerrymandering, the drawing of district lines to benefit a particular party or group, impacts the political, ideological, racial, and ethnic makeup of a legislative body.
- Partisan gerrymandering aims to maximize the majority party's representation, and the Supreme Court has yet to find a constitutional standard to restrict it.
- Cracking and packing are gerrymandering techniques: cracking divides a minority party's voters across districts, while packing concentrates them into a smaller number of districts.

Important facts from the text:

- The term "gerrymandering" originated in 1812 when the Massachusetts Legislature redrew a convoluted district, depicted as a salamander in a political cartoon, hence termed "Gerrymander."
- Racial or ethnic gerrymandering has faced legal scrutiny, as government discrimination based on race violates the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment.
- Texas and eight other states historically required preclearance under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but the requirement was removed after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Shelby v. Holder.
- Various states have adopted alternatives to legislative gerrymandering, such as independent commissions or demographers/redistricting staff handling the initial drawing of district maps.
