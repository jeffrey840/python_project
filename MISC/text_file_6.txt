Important facts:

1. **Fragmentation of Judicial Branch:** Texas has two courts of final appeal - the Texas Supreme Court for civil matters and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for criminal matters. This fragmentation causes confusion and minimal coordination among the numerous courts.

2. **Qualifications and Selection of Judges:** Lower-level judges in Texas, like county judges and justices of the peace, aren't required to be lawyers. The method of their selection, which involves partisan elections, raises concerns about their qualifications.

3. **Voting Rights Limitations:** Article 6 of the Texas Constitution sets restrictions on suffrage, denying voting rights to individuals under 18, certain convicted felons, and those deemed mentally incompetent by a court.

4. **Absence of Direct Democracy Methods:** Texas lacks statewide initiative, referendum, and popular recall processes. Unlike many other states, these democratic processes to involve citizens in lawmaking aren't allowed at the state level.

5. **Public Education Mandate:** Article 7 of the Texas Constitution emphasizes the responsibility of the Legislature to establish and maintain an efficient system of public free schools, aiming for a widespread dissemination of knowledge.
